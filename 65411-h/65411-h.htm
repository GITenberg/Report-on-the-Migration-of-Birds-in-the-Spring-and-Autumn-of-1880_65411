<p>The following Report contains a Summary of the
investigations of a Committee appointed by the British
Association for the Advancement of Science at Swansea
in 1880, an Abstract of which will be presented to the
Association at its next Meeting.</p>

<p>The Returns relating to Scotland have been arranged
by <span class="smcap">Mr. Harvie-Brown</span>; those for the East Coast of
England, by Mr. Cordeaux; and the West Coast of
England, by Mr. Philip Kermode.</p>

<p>"I am fixing correspondents in every corner of these northern regions, like so
many pickets and outposts; so that scarcely a Wren or a Tit shall be able to pass
from York to Canada but I shall get intelligence of it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>,
in 1808. (<i>Vide</i> Constable's Edition, 1831, p. xlix.)</p>
</div>


<h2 id="EAST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND.</h2>

<p><i>Iceland and Faroe.</i>&mdash;Schedules, letters of instruction, and
additional remarks were forwarded through Mr. Alexander
Buchan (Secretary, Scottish Meteorological Society, Edinburgh),
to three stations, two of which, Stykkisholm and Reykavik, are
in Iceland, and one at Thorshavn in Faroe. A fourth more
northern station is secured at Fair Island for 1881, Mr. William
Lawrence having kindly undertaken the work.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Our Faroe
station has failed us this year, but we hope better things from it
next.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> At a later date I received a letter (dated 17th March) from Mr. Lawrence,
containing a few items of interest. During the week previous, "A number
of Swans took shelter at Fair Isle, and a large flock of common Black Crows,
with a few Jackdaws amongst them. The Hooded Crow is the common one
here, and we never have the Black Crow here unless after, or during, gales
of wind. Puffins and Guillemots arrived somewhat later this season, and a
large increase appeared in the number of Gulls. Lapwings appeared, and
one Coot was caught in a very disabled condition. Large flocks of Snowbirds
are seen here. They came very early in winter, but disappeared again
till now, when they have returned. A large flock of Wild Geese arrived
here on the 14th inst. We do not often see them here. Four Swans were
caught; the largest weighed twenty pounds, and the others from that down
to sixteen pounds."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">-2-</span></p>

<p>Printed schedules, letters of instructions, and additional
remarks were forwarded to twenty-six stations on the East Coast
of Scotland and the Shetland and Orkney Islands, making, with
the Iceland and Faroe stations, thirty-nine in all for 1880. With
Fair Isle for 1881 we shall have forty stations.</p>

<p>Eight stations on the East Scottish coasts returned filled-in
schedules, against thirteen last year, out of a total of twenty-six.
This shows a falling off from last year. The reasons for this
I have endeavoured to explain in my general remarks further on,
under both East and West Coast. Scarcity of birds is reported
from several stations.</p>

<p>The stations from which co-operation was asked are the
following, commencing with the most northerly. Those from
which returns have been received are marked with a *; those
which sent returns both last year and this year have two **;
those which sent none last year but have done so this year have
a &#8224; prefixed; those which sent returns last year but none this
year are printed in <i>italics</i>. In future Reports we will prefix to
each station the years in which these stations make returns.
A marked improvement appears, however, in the returns which
we have received, these being fuller than in 1879.</p>

<p>We would like, however, to direct the special attention of our
reporters, both on the East and West Coasts, to the desirability
of recording exactly the <i>directions of flight</i> of the birds observed
in every case, so far as practicable, arid to minuti&aelig; of dates, even
of single occurrences. Let us also impress that even a single
accurate return, or one entry only in a schedule, is often of value;
and even if solitary occurrences of birds take place at a station,
such should be sent to me, though the schedule be otherwise a
blank. The interest has this season been better kept up on the
West Coast stations than at the East Coast ones, judging from
the scarcity of returned schedules from the latter. When no
schedules are returned, I would esteem it a great favour if the
lighthouse-keepers would kindly drop me a post-card, stating if
there is any reason for no returns being sent, such as pressure of
duties, scarcity of birds, or other causes.</p>

<p>In connection with the migration of 1880, I have to mention
that considerable aid to the work has been given by Mr. James
Hardy, of Old Cambus, Berwickshire. He writes to me (22nd
Feb. 1881), "I have drawn out a scheme of all the memoranda
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">-3-</span>
I can find about last year's migratory birds. I only await a
Northumberland and Berwickshire list to have it ready." Later
I received a summary of this from Mr. Hardy, which will be found
at the end of this East Coast of Scotland Report. As an example
of careful and minute field-study it is alone deserving of the
attention of observers, and it proves valuable upon comparison
with the other data. Those reading the lighthouse reports here
under the species, should also compare with Mr. Hardy's local
Berwickshire observations. I beg to propose Mr. Hardy as a
member of our Committee.</p>

<p>&#8224; Records and Schedule dating after 22nd Nov. were filled in by Mr. John
Wilson. Prior to this date they were filled in by Mr. William Anderson,
who has been since transferred to St. Abb's Head.</p>

<p>&#8225; No schedule was returned, but one note upon Swans, in a letter, proves
useful (<i>vide</i> Swan). "No birds struck the lights this year."</p>

<p>&sect; Schedule returned with the remark, "Nothing of importance has been
observed at this station during 1880." In 1879 a similar scarcity noted at
this locality.</p>

<p>&#9553; We have lost a good observer here, Mr. George Maclachlan having left.</p>

<p>&para; I am anxious to receive returns from this locality, not having received
any hitherto. I have to thank Mr. W. Anderson for a very full return at
Sumburgh Head up to Nov. 22nd. I hope he will find St. Abb's as interesting
a locality, though, I fear, the Great Siren horn, with its unearthly shriek,
will prove a great scare to migrants in a fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">-4-</span></p>

<p>I am also indebted to many other persons for interesting notes
from various localities, bearing upon the subject of migration.
A selection of these I will take notice of in the following report
separately, under the head "<i>Notes</i>," as I consider it advisable to
keep the one set of observations apart from the other. Further
notice of similar observations will be found in my "Third Report
on Scottish Ornithology," now preparing for press and partly read
to the Natural History Society of Glasgow, on Jan. 25th, 1881,
being a continuation of Reports read to the same Society, in 1880
and 1879, and relating to 1878-79, 1879-80. Many data will be
found in these Reports having close and intimate connection with
the Migration Reports proper.</p>

<p>As nearly as can be ascertained, notes have been kept by our
east-coast reporters upon nine species of waterfowl and thirty
species of land birds.</p>

<p>The new feature of this Report is the separate treatment of
the spring and autumn migrations, owing to the greater length of
time over which our reporters made notes. Another new feature
is the obituary&mdash;or list of deaths&mdash;at the different stations.</p>

<p>In my Report on the East Coast of Scotland, however, I have
not thought it necessary to keep the spring migration distinct,
owing to the comparative scarcity of records on our East Coast,
but in my West Coast Report I do so. Nor have I given an
obituary for either coast, as the numbers on all the Scottish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">-5-</span>
coasts is inappreciable. As will be seen further on, it is a very
different matter at the low-lying lanterns of the light-vessels off
the English coast. At the same time I sufficiently distinguish
between the spring and autumn records, and where large numbers
of birds are killed I make mention of it under the separate species.</p>


<h4 id="SEPARATE_REPORT_ON_EACH_SPECIES_1">SEPARATE REPORT ON EACH SPECIES.</h4>

<p>I have purposely in one or two instances varied the arrangement
of the statistics under the species,&mdash;as, for instance, under
the <i>Corvid&aelig;</i>,&mdash;thinking that possibly such variation may place
in juxtaposition certain fresh considerations or combinations in
our study, or place these in a clearer light for future comparison.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Returns from N. Unst, Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May, which, be it
noted, are all insular localities. On Sept. 3rd one Sparrowhawk,
chasing small birds, seen on Pentland Skerries at 9 a.m., fresh
S.W. and haze. This appears the earliest date recorded on which
the <i>Raptores</i> visit the islands on predatory raids in autumn. The
only record at Isle of May was in the month of May, when two
"falcons" were seen. On Sept. 13th a Rough-legged Buzzard (?)
flew about all day on Whalsey Skerries, wind light S.E. and
haze; and on Sept. 30th a "Glede Hawk" (from internal
evidence probably a Peregrine) flew about; wind fresh N.E. and
clear; seen at 8 a.m. On Oct. 3rd a "falcon" visited the Pentland
Skerries, and flew round for a time; seen at 3 p.m., wind
strong N. and haze; and on the same date and in the same
place, two Sparrowhawks at 1.30 p.m. During Oct. 14th, 16th,
and 17th, the so-called "Glede Hawks" remained preying upon
Snow Buntings, and were joined by a Sparrowhawk (or Merlin ?)
on the 17th, wind fresh N. to W., to strong N.W. At Sumburgh
Head, Nov. 28th, a "Brown Hawk" was noticed at noon, during
S.W. wind, with haze and rain; and a "large Grey Hawk,"
seen flying S., with fresh N. breeze, at 8.30 a.m.</p>

<p><i>Notes.</i>&mdash;It is recorded that a White-tailed Eagle struck on
Girdleness lighthouse a few years previous to 1853 ('The Naturalist,'
1853, p. 139). At North Unst the following species are
noted as resident:&mdash;Three species of Gulls, probably Kittiwake,
Herring Gull, and Great Black-backed Gull. Iceland Gulls appear
from October till March, but were scarcer this year than any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">-6-</span>
which Mr. Burnett remembers. The Black Crow (?), Hooded
Crow, Snipe, Starling, Titlark, and House Sparrow are included
amongst residents. An occasional White-tailed Eagle is seen,
and several kinds of hawks. Of all the sea-birds the Petrel is
the only one that strikes on the lanterns. As it is usually in the
morning when the rock-birds are first seen on arrival in spring,
the time of their arrival is supposed to be during the night, and
the direction of their coming is unknown.&mdash;(Signed, Robert
Burnett.) Mr. Burnett adds, "The only rare bird I have heard
of in this neighbourhood was a Hoopoe." I paid a visit to the
Isle of May on June 24th, 1880, and made Mr. Agnew's personal
acquaintance. During a hurried visit of less than two hours my
companion and myself rowed round the cliff portion of the island,
and also landed and walked over a considerable part of the lower-lying
portion of at the N.W. end. We saw the following species
engaged in incubation:&mdash;Oystercatchers, Eider Ducks, Guillemots,
Razorbills, Kittiwakes, and Rock Pipits. We searched in vain for
any species of Tern; a single Redshank was seen. Mr. Agnew's
son saw a Black Guillemot a few days before, and Mr. J. H.
Buchanan, who was out in the S.S. 'Fiery Cross' the previous
Thursday, "thought" he saw one also. The Agnews cannot say
if they breed there or not, but their being seen there occasionally
would make it worth while, if time permitted, to search carefully
the suitable clefts and caverns in the lower rocks. It was
reported to me that the sea-birds have increased greatly on The
May since the Sea-birds Bill came into force. The eggs, however,
are still taken wholesale by fishermen from the Fife coast
and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Owls.</span>&mdash;The only record occurs at Auskerry, where one was
seen after midnight on Oct. 21st, and remained about for some
time; exact species not noted.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Curiously enough, on the same date, numbers of
Short-eared Owls were to be seen in the flesh in the birdstuffers'
shops in Edinburgh. This shows the value of even single records
at lighthouse stations, as, were it not for the above Auskerry
record, the other fact would stand alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallows.</span>&mdash;During the spring migration these were taken
notice of at Isle of May, Auskerry, and Sumburgh Head. The
earliest record is at Isle of May, on April 30th, when two were
seen flying N.W. at 10 a.m., flying with a light S.E. breeze, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span>
clear. Then at Sumburgh Head, two on May 16th, one on 19th,
and two on 29th, during the daytime; winds variable, fine, clear
to haze, or showery; threatening but fine on 19th; and two were
seen at Auskerry on May 31st at noon, wind S.S.E., haze.
Lastly, on June 2nd, at Auskerry, two were seen flying S.,
against a S. gale, with haze; and this last is properly no doubt
assignable to the commencement of the autumn migration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren.</span>&mdash;Recorded at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May only.
On October 29th at the former, when one was seen flying about
the island; wind N.E., with snow-showers; and on Oct. 13th, at
the latter, with light E. wind, and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldcrest</span>, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>.&mdash;The only spring record is on
April 12th at Sumburgh Head, where "some" were seen resting
on the dykes between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.; wind E., light, with
fog. In the autumn migrations, they are recorded from two
stations, <i>viz.</i>, Tarbat Ness and Isle of May. They appeared on
Isle of May on Oct. 8th, when a number were seen, having
arrived during the previous night; wind strong S.E., showery.
Mr. Agnew notes this as "an early appearance," and notes also
"none seen here last year." On Oct. 15th more Goldcrests
appeared on the same island at 4 a.m., and one was wounded at
the glass; wind variable and light; clear. On Nov. 1st one bird
struck at midnight, in strong N. wind, with snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>Erithaca rubecula</i>.&mdash;Occurred at three stations&mdash;Tarbat
Ness, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. A rush appears to
have taken place about the time of the earliest date&mdash;on the 15th
August&mdash;past the Bell Rock. "Great numbers along with
Wheatears, Redshanks, and many small birds unidentified,
struck the dome and lantern between 1 and 2 a.m.; wind light
N.E. and rain. None were found dead on the balcony, but many
struck; some lightly, and flew away again; others harder, and
were seen fluttering away into the darkness. No doubt many
perished in the sea." The next date is the 18th Sept., at Isle of
May, when one was seen. "None seen last year." On Oct.
13th, on Isle of May, another large migration was noticed, many
being seen upon the island, having arrived during the night.
On Nov. 2nd, at Tarbat Ness, one struck at 8 p.m.; strong N.W.
wind, with showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &aelig;nanthe</i>.&mdash;The northernmost locality
given is North Unst, where a few strike the lantern during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span>
season, but no dates are given. Thence southwards, they are
noted at five other stations, <i>viz.</i>, Whalsey, Sumburgh Head,
Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, and the Bell Rock. The earliest
date is August 4th, at Pentland Skerries, where one struck at
11.30 p.m.; wind strong E., and haze. The reporter adds the
note:&mdash;"Starlings and Wheatears generally strike at night,
when the wind shifts with rain. They probably leave resting-places,
and, when once on wing, are attracted by the light." On
Aug. 14th another single bird struck at 10.15 p.m.; wind light
S.E., and fog: three more on 15th, from 9 to 11 p.m.; wind the
same, with haze. At Sumburgh Head, on Aug. 11th, one young
bird struck; wind light N., and fog. At Whalsey, on 16th,
about twelve old and young were flying round the lantern at
1 a.m.; wind light W., and haze. At Bell Rock, Aug. 15th,
great numbers along with Robins. At Auskerry, Sept. 5th,
three struck at 3 a.m.; wind strong S., with haze and showers.
The latest date recorded is Sept. 13th, at Pentland Skerries,
when two struck at 2 a.m.; wind fresh S.W., and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titmice.</span>&mdash;At Isle of May, Aug. 10th and 11th, a migration
was noticed: 10th, the first pair came to the lights, and one was
wounded; 11th, great numbers were seen on the island; wind
light E., haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagtail.</span>&mdash;At Whalsey&mdash;the only station returning a record
of this species&mdash;large flocks rested, arriving on Aug. 21st; wind
light S.E., with dense fog, which lasted till 28th, on which date
they all again departed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titlark</span>, <i>Anthus pratensis</i>.&mdash;Noted as leaving Whalsey
Skerries in the first week of September; wind at the time S. to
S.E., with from haze to fog during the days. The note is
added, "A few remain." These are probably Rock Pipits.
The only other station whence I have records is the Isle of May.
A very large migration of Titlarks (called "Woodlarks" in
schedule) came during the night of Dec. 21st-22nd; wind light
E., and clear; and on the 22nd, "The island was literally
swarming with them; flocks of from twenty to one hundred or
more." Mr. Agnew "never saw so many here before."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Records came in from Sumburgh Head in the
north, to Isle of May in the south, and from Auskerry. One
record at Sumburgh applies to the spring migration, <i>viz.</i>, on
April 1st, when several Blackbirds (<i>Turdus merula</i>) were seen at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
10 a.m.; wind squally S.S.E; changeable weather, with haze
and rain. In the autumn migration we have more returns, but
none before Nov. 1st, when the first Thrush was seen at 2 a.m.;
wind strong W., with showers, at Auskerry. At Isle of May,
Nov. 1st, "Mountain Thrush" was seen at 2 p.m.; wind light
S.W., and haze. Thereafter on Dec. 15th, at the same place, a
very large flock of "Mountain Thrushes" at 2 p.m.; wind light
S., and snow. Again, on 22nd, two birds of same species,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
one on Jan. 1st; wind light E. to S.S.E., and haze. At
Sumburgh Head, Jan. 14th, 1881, one Blackbird at noon; calm
and clear.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> There can be little doubt, I think, that Fieldfares are meant. Ring
Ouzels are usually denominated "Mountain Blackbirds." Indeed, amongst
a collection of local names which I have gathered, I find the name of
"Mountain Thrush" applied to the Fieldfare.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The spring migration is referred to under Sumburgh
Head on April 4th and 5th. On April 4th some Crows
["species not known"] seen flying S.E.; wind S.S.E., fine. On
the 5th a gale blew from the South. The autumn migration has
eight entries under three stations, <i>viz.</i>, Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries (five dates), and Tarbat Ness. Only two species&mdash;Ravens
and Hooded Crows&mdash;are noted. At Pentland Skerries,
two Ravens on Sept. 29th at 3.30 p.m.; wind moderate S., clear;
one on Oct. 9th, wind light E.; and two on Jan. 13th, 1881, at
11 a.m., wind fresh N.E., with showers alternating with clear.
At Sumburgh Head, Hooded Crows arrived on Dec. 5th, and
remained all winter; and five were seen on Dec. 1st, at 2.30 p.m.;
wind moderate W., and showers; and four on Dec. 29th, at
1.30 p.m.; wind light E., and clear; and two on Jan. 13th, at
11 a.m.; wind fresh N.E., clear, alternating with snow-showers.
At Tarbat Ness great numbers continued along shore in Jan.,
1881, owing to severity of the weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;At Pentland Skerries and Isle of
May. Earliest dates July 5th and 11th, at Isle of May. Latest
date (but only three records altogether) 12th Sept., at Pentland
Skerries. Four struck at 11 a.m.; wind fresh S., clear; Pentland
Skerries, on 12th Sept. Flock of young at 10 a.m.; wind
W., clear; remained two days at Isle of May on same date.
Very large flock of young at 7 p.m.; wind N.W., light and clear,
at the same station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span>, <i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>.&mdash;At Isle of May, Oct. 19th, a
few seen: this is rather later than usual.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The only record on the west coast agrees with this,
however, at Bahama L. V. (<i>q. v.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span>, <i>Fringilla cannabina ?</i>&mdash;The spring migration represented
only at Isle of May by one bird at 7 p.m.; wind light W.,
clear, on May 18th; and by two birds at 10 a.m. same night;
wind light W., clear. In autumn, at Sumburgh Head, from
sixteen to twenty seen on Dec. 2nd, at 10 a.m.; wind fresh N.,
haze and rain; and six on Jan. 3rd, 1881; wind strong S.W.,
haze. Previous to this latter date the weather was severe until
Jan. 2nd, 1881. Snow and frost all gone on 3rd. "Until of late,
birds very scarce."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellowhammer.</span>&mdash;At Isle of May, first seen (only record) on
Oct. 7th; wind N.E. gale, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting</span>, <i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>.&mdash;Recorded from the
following stations:&mdash;Whalsey, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries,
Isle of May, Inch Keith. In all thirteen entries. Earliest date
Sept. 13th, at Whalsey, when large flocks arrived and stayed
thereafter all winter; wind on Sept. 13th N., with showers.
Latest date noted Dec. 29th, at Pentland Skerries, when large
flock seen on island at 11.15 a.m.; wind strong N.E., hail.
Between these dates: Oct. 27th, at Isle of May, a flock at 2 p.m.;
wind E.N.E., and heavy hail-showers. 28th, Pentland Skerries,
a flock on the island at 1 p.m.; wind strong N.E., and hail. At
Pentland Skerries, Nov. 6th, a few&mdash;five killed&mdash;from 7 to 11 p.m.;
wind W., showers. At Isle of May, 13th, a flock at 2 p.m.; wind
light W., clear. 29th, one bird killed at same station at 6 a.m.;
wind light W., haze. At Sumburgh Head, Dec. 5th, ten seen at
1 p.m.; wind fresh S.W., haze and rain. At Inch Keith, Dec.
10th, large flock at 9 a.m., remained twenty-four hours; 15th,
very large flock at 11 a.m.; wind light S., snow. At Pentland
Skerries, Dec. 19th, flock at 2.15 p.m.; wind strong S.E., rain.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. Hardy notes the earliest appearance on 18th Oct.
in East Lothian&mdash;a single bird near Thornton Loch, on the
public road, a field's-breadth from the sea-side. Wind N. and
tempestuous, with heavy rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sky Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;Records from Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest date Oct. 23rd, at
Sumburgh Head; one seen singing for a short time; wind N.W.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span>
fine, showers, and sunshine. Then Dec. 17th, at Pentland
Skerries, large flock all day on the island; wind fresh N.E.,
clear. Dec. 23rd, Isle of May, all left, not one to be seen.
Latest record Jan. 13th, 1881, Sumburgh Head; five seen
hovering round at 1.30 p.m.; wind light E., cloudy. 14th, two
at 11 a.m., rested; wind light N., clear; and on Nov. 2nd, seven
at 9 a.m., flying east or landwards; wind fresh S.E., hazy. On
Dec. 3rd, flocks at 11 a.m.; wind E., flying S.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Pigeon</span>, <i>Columba livia</i>.&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, a flock
seen at 2 p.m.; wind light S.W., snow on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Plover</span>, <i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>.&mdash;Records reached me
from Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Tarbat Ness, and Isle of May
(ten entries, of which seven were at Pentland Skerries). Earliest
date July 23rd, when six were seen flying about the island&mdash;Pentland
Skerries&mdash;at 9 a.m.; wind light E. At Pentland
Skerries, Aug. 11th, a flock flying S.E. at 10.30 a.m.; wind
light W., clear. No more till Nov. 15th, when a flock remained
a week at Auskerry, arriving at 11 a.m., with light N.E. wind.
At Tarbat Ness, Nov. 11th, hundreds all day till 4 p.m.; wind
N. to W. with snow. Nov. 21st, at 3.30 p.m., a flock on island
at Pentland Skerries; wind fresh S.W., clear. At Pentland
Skerries, Dec. 16th, a flock flying N. at 10.30 a.m.; wind fresh
S.W., and snow. At Isle of May, Dec. 22nd, one bird. "They
are not seen here every year, and most in severe weather."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oystercatcher</span>, <i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>.&mdash;At Sumburgh Head,
Aug. 28th, all left after the fog of 21st&mdash;28th cleared away; as
did other species, including Wheatears, Wagtails, and Rock-birds.
At Auskerry, five arrived, with light S. wind and haze,
and remained a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heron</span>, <i>Ardea cinerea</i>.&mdash;At Isle of May, July 22nd, a flock of
six flying S. at 2.30 p.m.; wind light E., clear. At Pentland
Skerries, Sept. 9th, seven at 5 a.m.; wind light W., clear. At
Sumburgh Head, Sept. 19th, three flying about at 10 a.m.; wind
N.W., and haze. At Auskerry, Oct. 8th, two arrived at 2 p.m.;
wind light E., clear; and remained; and at same station on
21st, twelve arrived at 11.30 a.m.; wind light N., and remained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, <i>Numenius arquata</i>.&mdash;One record (April 13th) belongs
to the spring migration. One was seen flying S.E. at 11 a.m.;
wind S., and haze. At Sumburgh Head, Aug. 12th, six seen
flying W. and crying loudly at 12.30 p.m.; wind S.W., and haze.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span>
2nd, seven flying about, and then taking off W. and crying loudly
at 1 p.m.; wind light S.W., haze. At Auskerry, Oct. 9th, five at
1 p.m.; wind light E., clear; and remained. At Isle of May,
Curlews had been on the island for weeks.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. Dunn, Dalkeith Gardens, "heard a Curlew when
calling, some 800 to 1000 feet up in the air." It was flying due
W. on Dec. 26th. The sky was clear and the sun shining at the
time&mdash;about 1 p.m. Wind light from W. in morning; calm at
the time. For the previous six days the wind veered between S.
by W. to N., the prevailing wind being S.W. Weather "very
cold that day, and for a few days before and after." Being a
station of the Scottish Meteorological Society, the above statistics
are exact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redshank and Sandpiper</span>, <i>Totanus calidris</i>.&mdash;At Isle of May,
Dec. 27th, three Sandpipers seen at 4 p.m.; wind N.E., haze;
and on Jan. 3rd, at same place, a Redshank shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe</span>, <i>Scolopax gallinago</i>.&mdash;At Auskerry, Pentland Skerries,
and Isle of May. At Isle of May, Sept. 12th, one killed at lantern
at 4 a.m.; wind N.E., fresh, and rain. At Pentland Skerries,
Oct. 2nd, two killed at 8.30 p.m., during strong N. wind, haze,
and rain. At Auskerry, Oct. 21st, two arrived at 3.45, and
remained; wind strong N. At Isle of May, Jan. 12th, a number
arrived at night; wind fresh N.E., and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span>, <i>Scolopax rusticola</i>.&mdash;At Isle of May, Oct. 9th, one
seen at 5 a.m.; wind strong N.E., and showers; this is earlier
than usual. At Isle of May, Oct. 19th, more arrived during the
night or morning, with N.E. gale, and showers. At Auskerry,
Oct. 21st, one arrived at 3.30 p.m., and remained; wind strong
N., with sleet. On Nov. 16th considerable numbers came during
the night. These are the latest Mr. Agnew remembers to have
seen, by several weeks. At Pentland Skerries, Nov. 29th, one on
the island at morn; wind strong W., and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goose</span>, <i>Anser</i>.&mdash;On Oct 14th a flock of "Grey Geese" flying
S.E., at 10.45 a.m., past the Pentland Skerries; wind fresh N.W.,
and showers. Again on Oct. 24th another flock of the same
flying also S.E. at 5.15 p.m.; wind also fresh N.W., clear.
Again on 26th Oct. a flock of the same flying N. at 6.30 a.m.;
wind strong N., and showers; all the above probably indicating
only a local migration&mdash;to and fro. At Isle of May, Oct. 26th, a
large flock flying N., with westerly gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">-13-</span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. Dunn, Dalkeith Gardens, "observed a &gt;-shaped
flock of about forty Wild Geese, about six hundred feet from the
surface of the earth, flying in an easterly direction on the 16th
December. They made a considerable noise in their flight. The
wind at the time was N.W., and for the six previous days it
ranged from W. to N., on one day only chopping round to S., <i>viz.</i>,
on 15th, which was the day before we saw the Geese. Snow was
lying on the ground at the time, and the next seven days were
cold, dull, and stormy, with more or less snow falling every day.
Flights of Geese are not common in this district, hence the
interest taken in the above." Could we get a number of similar
records from inland observers, how useful they would be for
comparison with our coast stations.&mdash;[J. A. H. B.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swan</span>, <i>Cygnus</i>.&mdash;At Sumburgh Head, Jan. 30th, 1881, twenty
wild Swans seen, first a mile off, flying along the shore very
slowly, and lowering, apparently much exhausted. At North
Ronaldshay, Dec. 23rd, 1880, sixteen Swans seen; they stayed
on a large loch about two weeks, during a heavy fall of snow,
and flew off north when the thaw commenced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks.</span>&mdash;Two records on April 1st at Whalsey and Sumburgh
Head, referable to the spring migration. At Whalsey, Eider
Ducks (or "Dunters") arrived about this date, and at Sumburgh
Head, Sheldrakes arrived on this date, at 10 a.m.; wind strong
S.S.E., with showers. In the autumn migration, notes have
been taken at Whalsey, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and
Isle of May (eight entries). Eiders said to leave about August,
and the note is added that, "after the Ducks have sat eight or
ten days, the Drakes all disappear from the neighbourhood."
On Sept. 12th, twelve male Eiders seen at 3 p.m.; wind S., and
fine, with haze. At Pentland Skerries, Sept. 14th, a flock,
mostly males, seen flying E.; wind light E., and rain. Sept.
25th, at same station, a flock of male and female Eiders flying
E.; wind light E., rain. At Isle of May, Oct. 19th, a "small
duck." At Isle of May, Dec. 22nd, "a flock of ducks" swam
along shore. At Tarbat Ness, Dec. 30th, flocks of from eight to
ten "ducks" seen from 2 to 3.30 p.m.; wind light N., and snow.
At Isle of May, Jan. 13th, three "Wild Ducks" seen; wind
E.N.E., gale, and snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Birds.</span>&mdash;Records at North Unst, Whalsey, and Sumburgh
refer to spring arrival. At North Unst, April 25th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">-14-</span>
innumerable Puffins and rock-birds arrived; wind fresh N.W.,
and clear. At Whalsey, March 15th, the rock-birds arrived. At
Sumburgh, March 4th, they arrived about 7 a.m. In autumn,
all left Whalsey on Aug. 28th after the fog, which had hung
since the 21st, cleared off. At Pentland Skerries, July 25th, a
flock of Guillemots seen flying E. at 7 p.m., with moderate E.
wind. On Aug. 4th, two flocks flying E. between 3 and 4 p.m.,
with light S. wind; and on Aug. 25th, three flocks seen flying E.
between 5 and 8 p.m., with light S.W. airs.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. M. Vaughan&mdash;to whom I am indebted for supplementary
notes&mdash;writes that Rock-birds, Gannets, and Cormorants
were scarcer than usual in Orkney during the first week in
August. I have no return this year from Dunnet Head, but Mr.
Geo. Maclachlan, says, "There are over 3000 Guillemots hatched
here, and I am able to count (say) 175 in 350." At the Isle of
May, Eiders arrived about Oct. 1st, coming, it is believed, to
winter from the Isle of May and Fidra. They remain till end
of March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gulls.</span>&mdash;At Sumburgh Head, Oct. 23rd, one Iceland Gull seen
at 8 a.m.; wind N.W., with showers. This is the first seen.
They come in October and leave in April. At same station, Nov.
22nd, another Iceland Gull at 10 a.m.; wind fresh S.W., and
clear. At Tarbat Ness, Dec. 24th, two ("Iceland Gulls") at
11 a.m.; wind light N.E., and sleet.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;These "Iceland Gulls" maybe true <i>Larus islandicus</i>
or Iceland Gull <i>vera</i>, but more probably are Glaucous Gulls
(<i>Larus glaucus</i>). The incident below related is confirmed by a
letter received from Mr. Jack, the head light-keeper at the Bell
Rock lighthouse:&mdash;"Arbroath: A Fact for Naturalists.&mdash;Our
Arbroath correspondent writes:&mdash;A curious story of a sea-bird is
in circulation here, and I send it you, as it has been related to me
on what seems fairly good authority. The other day a white Sea
Gull of the Kittiwake variety was seen flying about the signal-tower
of the Bell Rock lighthouse. The bird was evidently in
distress, and one of the lighthouse-keepers opening a window, held
out his hands, when it came to him. The bird, in taking a bait
fixed to a line, had swallowed the hook, and the line, with its
handle, a stick about a foot long, was dependent from the bird's
mouth. The light-keeper cut away the string as far down the
bird's throat as he could reach, and the bird flew away evidently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
relieved.&mdash;'Scotsman,' 1st May, 1880." Mr. Jack writes as
follows, 10th May, 1880:&mdash;"It is quite true about the Sea Gull.
It was so unusual to see a string attached to the bird, that
I opened the window of my bedroom and leaned out to look at it,
when, strange to say, it came towards me. Without thinking for
a moment that the creature would really come to me, I held out
my hands towards it, when it came close up to me. I took hold
of it and brought it inside, and called to my two assistants (who
were looking out of another window a few feet from mine) to
'look at this.' So surprised were they both at the whole affair,
that after we had relieved the poor bird, one of my assistants
declared that, when he got on shore in turn, he would state the
case to the editor of the 'Guide' newspaper." "Poor little
creature!" adds my correspondent, "it was a pleasant sight to
see it on its flight away, and not as it arrived, weary and worn
out." One has only to imagine the Bell Rock as the Ark in the
midst of the waters, and the Gull a Dove. As I am speaking
now of the Bell Rock, I may note here that large numbers of
Long-tailed Ducks are reported by Mr. Jack as frequenting the
vicinity of the rock in winter, constantly uttering their peculiar
cry of "Co-co-candle-wick." Solan Geese are perpetually in sight
summer and winter, flying round the rock or fishing. Mr. Jack
also tells us that single birds of different species come crash
against the dome or windows with terrific force, and rebounding
off are seldom even seen, but leave often their blood and brains
scattered about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skua</span>, <i>Lestris catarractes</i>.&mdash;Reported as seen at North Unst
first on April 18th. About the same number is counted, <i>viz.</i>,
six or eight each year. In autumn, at Sumburgh Head, one
"Bonzie" was seen flying W. at noon; wind S.S.W., haze; and
the note is added, "The first seen (in autumn?) for eight years."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terns</span>, <i>Sternin&aelig;</i>.&mdash;Two records referable to spring migration
at Whalsey and Sumburgh Head. Arriving at former about
May 15th and at the latter on May 16th, at 9.40, with variable
winds, fine, and clear. In autumn, records at Whalsey, Sumburgh
Head, Auskerry, and Bell Rock. They disappeared from
Bell Rock on Aug. 23rd, "not, however, from want of food, as
plenty soil of herring are around the rock." They had been
about the rock for a fortnight, feeding. They disappeared from
Whalsey, Aug. 25th, after the fog of 21st&mdash;28th, at the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
time with Wheatears, Oystercatchers, Wagtails, and rock-birds.
At Bell Rock, Aug. 28th, about thirty old and young were seen
feeding; and on the 29th these all left. At Sumburgh Head,
Sept. 8th, a number flying about and crying at 9 a.m.; wind W.,
light and haze. At Auskerry, Oct. 1st, four flew round for a
little about 1 a.m.; wind light E., rain.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. T. Garriock, to whom I am obliged for
a supplementary schedule from Lerwick, recorded in 'The
Zoologist' for 1880 the arrival of Terns, apparently from the
north, on May 22nd, when a pair was first noticed. In a subsequent
letter to me, Mr. Garriock confirms his observation on
the direction of their flight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrel</span>, <i>Thalassidroma pelagica</i>.&mdash;Occasionally strikes the
lantern during the season at North Unst, but no dates given.
At Whalsey, Aug. 16th, one caught at 1 a.m.; wind light N.W.,
haze. At Sumburgh Head, Aug. 3rd, three struck at 11 p.m.;
wind N.N.W., dull, and sultry; and on the 6th, one struck at
midnight; wind S., and haze. At Auskerry, Aug. 16th, one
killed at 11.20 p.m.; light S. breeze, fog, and haze. One
struck at Auskerry, Sept. 13th, at 3 a.m.; wind strong S., and
haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gannet</span>, <i>Sula bassana</i>.&mdash;At Sumburgh Head, July 20th
(earliest date), great numbers, adult and young, flying in all
directions, feeding on herrings. At Pentland Skerries, July 19th,
30-40, flying E., wind N.E., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 20th, 50, flying
E., wind fresh N., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 21st, 60, flying E., wind
light N.E., clear, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 22nd, 25, flying E., wind
light N.E. airs, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 23rd, 25-30, flying E., wind
E., 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; 24th, 40, flying E., wind S.E., 9 a.m. to
7 p.m., fog, haze; 26th, 60, flying E., wind mod. E., 9 a.m. to
7 p.m., fog, haze; Aug. 4th, continuous flights, wind light E.,
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., fog, haze; 5th, continuous flights, wind moderate
W., 4.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Solan Geese were observed daily in flocks going E.,
from July 19th to middle of Sept.; and going W. on Aug. 19th,
20th, and 25th. About the middle of Sept. young appeared
amongst them. This note summarises to a great extent the
above data. At Tarbat Ness, Oct. 18th, 19th, and 20th, great
numbers flying N., wind S., 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Since the return
of the schedules Mr. Jack has written to me that&mdash;"On the 5th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">-17-</span>
February, 1881, the Bell Rock station was visited by the largest
flock of birds I have seen this winter, <i>viz.</i>. Larks, Rose Linnets,
Starlings, and other species which I did not see well enough to
make out. Time when seen, 2 till 5 a.m.; wind light S.W. on
arrival, and on departure fresh N.E. Fog and rain. Great
numbers struck, but none found dead, though doubtless many
fell into the sea. I have observed during the last two winters
that the Golden-crested Wren and the Common Wren have not
visited us as usual. I have seen these small birds thick on the
windows, night after night, during the fall of the year." It is
interesting to note here that between the 2nd and 11th March,
1880, a similar great migration took place past the Bell Rock, of
which an account is given in my last report for 1879 [<i>vide</i> Zool.,
May, 1880].<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> At Bell Rock, 18th Feb., a great number of Larks,
8 p.m., light E.S.E., haze. Great numbers struck, none lying
dead. Apparently this flock was entirely composed of Larks
greatly exhausted. A number seen asleep all night on window-sashes;
left at first streak of dawn. Feb. 19th, a small number
of birds (species not determined) flew about in the rays of light
all night; wind S.E., fresh, haze. 25th, great number of Larks
during the night; wind light W.; striking, but none found dead;
left, flying N.W. March 10th, one Black Crow seen asleep on
balcony rail; left flying N.E., at 7 a.m.; wind fresh W.S.W.,
haze. 17th, one "Snowflake" flying from N.W. to S.E.; wind
W.S.W., fresh, haze. In a letter accompanying this later
schedule, Mr. Jack writes (28th March, 1881):&mdash;"I am sorry to
say our close companions during winter, Dunters and Sea
Pheasants, are still with us in great numbers. This we know
by long observation to indicate that winter is not yet past for a
season, nor can we judge so until they have all been gone for a
week at least. In the fall of the year, when we see them return,
we well know that winter is at hand. When stationed in the
Isles of Shetland I have often remarked, when I heard much
howling going on amongst the seals, that no good weather could
be looked for, and I have never known this to fail."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Later in March this year, <i>viz.</i> the 19th, an indication of a returning (?)
migration of Shrikes is found in the occurrence of one bird at Bath Hill
Wood, West Grange, Perthshire, not very far removed from the Alloa
district. It was shot by Mr. J. Livingstone, and is now in the collection of
Mr. J. J. Dalgleish.</p>

<h3 id="General_Remarks_1"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>


<p>As already mentioned, we have received fewer returns this
year from the East Coast than in 1879, having returns only from
eight stations in 1880, against thirteen in 1879. This arises
principally from actual scarcity of birds at many stations, and at
some, from extra work devoted to duties of the reporters, owing to
fogs and stormy weather. This scarcity appears to have extended
all along our Scottish E. coast, and even showed itself for some
distance down the East English coast. That, at no time, can
our East of Scotland returns approach in magnitude those of
the East English coast, I fully believe, because, in the weather
most favourable for observation at the stations,&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, foggy or
thick nights,&mdash;lanterns placed a few feet above the water, as
they are in lightships, must attract far more birds than higher
lanterns at the lighthouses. The peculiar situations also of
many of our Scottish stations&mdash;in the midst of towns (as at
Cromarty and Kinnaird Head, in Frazerburgh), in inland bays
and arms of the sea (as at Chanonry, and at many localities
on our west coast)&mdash;must very materially alter the conditions
of observation. At our more northern stations the
lighthouses for the most part stand at great elevations, and it is
worthy of note that from such stations as the Bell Rock, Pentland
Skerries, and Whalsey Skerries, on the east coast, and
Dhuheartach and Skerryvore, on the west coast, &amp;c., we have the
best filled schedules, showing that stations upon lower and
isolated elevations are the best points of observation.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of my report for 1879, under the West Coast
stations, I take notice of the N.W. to S.E. trend of the migration
across Tyree and Loch Assapol in the Ross of Mull, and of the
direction taken by birds across the narrow part of Scotland
between the Firths of Forth and Clyde (<i>vide</i> 'The Zoologist,'
May, 1880, pp. 202-204).</p>

<p>My present impression&mdash;from these and many similar observations
in Stirlingshire and the districts named&mdash;is, that a semi-circular
migration is probably carried on; birds which strike our
coasts at more northerly points, or start from localities further
north in Scotland itself, at certain points trend more southerly
from their original E. to W. direction; and again, at certain
other points, again trend more easterly from their previous N. to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
S. direction, and pass finally, as far as our British Islands are
concerned, from N.W. to S.E. directions. This, of course, is
more patent in some seasons than in others, depending upon
prevailing winds and weather. Birds came to us all through the
migratory season from E. to W. across the North Sea, except in
1879 at the Galloper Bank <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> (Zool., May, 1880, p. 203). In
1879, I believe, as further indicated at the end of my report on
the West Coast, that the migration was compressed by prevailing
N.W. winds, and deflected further south, but in 1880 was more
expanded, or less compressed, by prevalence of N.E. and E. winds,
and that therefore the horizontal area of migration covered a
larger surface. In 1880 we thus find birds migrating from
directions south of East to directions north of West across the
English Channel, or crossing from France to England (<i>vide</i>
Cordeaux's Report <i>antea</i>). These points are put forward not as
intended to be conclusive, but simply for the purpose of
directing attention for further statistics. I will only further
direct attention here to my "Third Ornithological Report for
Scotland, 1880-81," read to the Natural History Society of
Glasgow, session 1880-81.</p>

<p>In our last Report, 1879 (Zool., May, 1880), under our lists of
lighthouses, we gave the descriptions of the lights, whether white
or red, fixed, flash, revolving, or intermittent, or with other lights
or action. What influence in attracting birds these various
descriptions of light have, it would not yet be easy to ascertain,
because&mdash;<i>given</i> the different colours and descriptions&mdash;we have
them at different localities, which makes it almost impossible to
compare them. However, broadly speaking, we would imagine
the <i>brightest</i>, <i>whitest</i>, <i>fixed</i> lights to have most influence in penetrating
fog or haze, and therefore of attracting birds. We
considered it advisable to give these descriptions in our first
Report, because we thought that in time such may prove of some
value when our knowledge of migration increases. In the Report
for 1880 we have not repeated these particulars, but, instead, we
give, after the name of each lighthouse station, the heights of the
lanterns above the sea, not because we can positively affirm that
the height of any given light influences the total of birds seen or
killed at that light, but because we believe that this particular
may possibly elicit facts in future. Some of our reporters state
extreme height above the sea as a cause of birds seldom or never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
striking the glass, or never being seen hovering round the light.
Certainly, returns show a preponderance of deaths or other records,
first, <i>at lightships</i> (the average height of the lights of which above
the sea is only a few feet); secondly, at such stations&mdash;upon
isolated rocks&mdash;as the Bell Rock, Dhuheartach, or Skerryvore
(the lanterns of which are not more than sixty or seventy
feet above the water); and a great preponderance above such
stations as Cape Wrath (which is 400 feet above the sea) or other
similarly elevated lights. During the daytime, whilst crossing
towards the English coasts and past the lightships, flocks are
usually seen flying low; and across the Firth of Forth and other
narrow estuaries the same thing is observed. At times birds are
seen passing high in air "<i>almost</i> beyond the range of vision,"
and when clouds or fogs rapidly lift or clear off during the
time of migration, the said migration appears often to "cease
to mortal vision," indicating, some say, a reascent to higher
levels. Birds also are known to <i>descend</i> upon Heligoland
almost perpendicularly from the sky, indicating, it is presumed,
a course of migration at a great height, and a descent therefrom
upon fog- or haze-covered land to rest or feed. To
birds passing through the air above, a <i>local fog</i> beneath probably
indicates <i>land in the midst of water</i>, and, if this be
so, hence a descent upon it. The various numerical returns
of those killed at lanterns are probably a good deal dependent
on the height at which birds fly in foggy weather. We might
call this the vertical area of birds' migration flight as opposed
to lateral area.</p>

<p>Now it seems that light-vessels always return the best-filled
schedules, and therefore a preponderance of birds are noticed all
along the East English Coast, where light-vessels are most
abundant. Whilst upon the East Scottish Coast the returns
are infinitely smaller where there are no light-vessels, but only
lighthouses, whose lanterns are at a greater height; and the
question very naturally arises, "If the Scottish coasts were
lighted with light-vessels, would not the number of records be
very considerably augmented?"</p>

<p><b>Notes from the Faroe Isles.</b></p>

<p>The following notes from Herr H. C. M&uuml;ller and Dr. Madsen,
of Thorshavn, Faroe, have been received too late for insertion in
the General Report, but not too late for addition as an Appendix.
These notes were all made after the 1st January, 1881. They
came to hand on May 1st, 1881:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cygnus musicus.</i>&mdash;Five Wild Swans were seen on Jan. 1st,
1881; three killed at Suder&ouml; on 22nd; one seen near Thorshavn
on 10th; probably all belonging to the same flock. Wind S.W.,
force 3-4. Rain.</p>

<p><i>Numenius arquata.</i>&mdash;One killed at Hvidenov, near Thorshavn,
on Jan. 30th. Wind S.S.E., force 4. Rain.</p>

<p><i>Columba palumbus</i>, Linn.&mdash;One seen along with <i>Columba livia</i>
at Thorshavn on Feb. 7th. wind E., force 5. Rain and hail.</p>

<p><i>Larus tridactylus</i>.&mdash;Four seen at Thorshavn at 10 a.m. on
Feb. 10th. Wind E., force 3-4. Snow.</p>

<p><i>Alauda arvensis.</i>&mdash;One hundred in a flock seen at Thorshavn
at 9 a.m. on March 8th, 1881. Wind S.W., fine. For the five
days previous storm from S.E.</p>

</div>


<p>Printed forms of enquiry and letters of instruction were sent
to thirty-seven lighthouses and light-vessels on the east coast of
England, and, through the kind co-operation of Mr. Cecil Smith,
to two of the principal lighthouses in the Channel Islands:
independent reports have also been received from four stations
on the east coast; and my best thanks are due to T. H. Nelson
and C. Donald Thompson, Teesmouth; M. Bailey, Flamborough;
Wm. Eagle Clarke and H. Bendelack Hewetson [Leeds]; notes
from Spurn Point. J. H. Gurney, jun., Northrepps, and Major
C. Russell, Essex, for supplying notices of the movements of
birds in their respective districts. These reports have either
been treated separately or incorporated with the nearest lighthouse.
I have also received many interesting notes from
Mr. G&auml;tke, on the migration of birds over Heligoland from
the commencement of June to the end of December, which are
especially welcome as a most valuable addition to the report.
Special thanks I also must tender to those various observers in
the lighthouses and light-vessels scattered along the east coast.
Altogether, out of forty-four stations, returns have been sent in
from thirty-eight; two other stations report no birds seen during
the autumn, from the circumstances of their situations in the
midst of houses; and only from four have no returns been made.
The observations are in many respects an improvement on those
of the preceding year, exhibiting in a marked degree the
intelligent interest taken by the observers in their work&mdash;work
which it must be remembered is entirely voluntary, and often
carried on under circumstances of considerable difficulty and
discomfort.</p>

<p>The east coast stations are as follows, those making returns
being marked with a *:&mdash;</p>

dearth of all those many flocks of shore birds&mdash;as Godwit, Grey
Plover, Knot&mdash;which visit the Humber mud-flats during the first
fortnight in May, on their passage to the north. On the opposite
coast of Yorkshire, under shelter of the sandy promontory of
Spurn, they assembled in large numbers, feeding daily on the
great expanse of muds left uncovered at ebb, and at flood crossing
to the sands on the sea side of Spurn. A correspondent writes
that, on May 7th, "countless thousands of waders lined the
beach, like wreck, on the sea-side about a mile above Spurn;

large flocks of Widgeon came into the Tees, and thirteen were
shot by one discharge of a single-barrelled shoulder-gun. At the
Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, April 18th, Wild Ducks were seen migrating
to N.W.; and on April 30th, every hour during day, to N.N.W.
At the Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>. May 19th, shoals of Ducks from W. to E.
From the Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, May 25th, 11.30 a.m., my
correspondent writes, "Saw two Sheldrakes leave their nest with
ten young ones at low water; had to travel half a mile before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span>
they reached the water; the male kept about six yards behind
the young, the female leading; they were fifteen minutes in
reaching the water; appeared just hatched; cock bird often
looked behind to see nobody was coming." With reference to
the spring migration of Wild Geese, Major Russell sends me the
following notes from a correspondent on the Essex coast, whose
house is situated on the south slope of a steep high hill:&mdash;"The
Grey Geese were seen on Saturday, Feb. 21st, from 600 to 1000
flying in a triangular form, in a N.E. direction. I have
repeatedly seen them sometimes passing for whole days, and
have always noticed that we have never had any winter to speak
of afterwards. They generally fly about a mile high. We very
seldom see them going south. I suppose because the days are
shorter, or possibly some may go another way; but they
generally go north about this time of the year. I used to try to
shoot them with a rifle to see what sort of Geese they were."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;At Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 9th, Guillemots and
Razorbills assembled; 24th, Puffins. At Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
May 3rd, hundreds of Puffins arriving throughout the day, and on
the same day a great number of Guillemots. From May 28th to
June 2nd, great numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills were seen
all day in the neighbourhood of the Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, at sea six miles
S.S.E. Spurn Point. The Guillemots, Razorbills and Puffins
are later in their arrival and departure at the southern than
their northern breeding-stations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 9th, numbers of
Gannets flying N. At the Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 16th, from
9 a.m. to 1 p.m., Gannets were seen flying N. At Teesmouth
5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, March 15th, twelve Cormorants came into Tees,
about fifty in every year at this time, leave again after breeding-season
till next March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Farne Islands, April 8th, Gulls commenced
assembling at their nesting-quarters. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Feb. 18th,
Herring Gulls first appeared on the cliffs near lighthouse.
July 4th, first young was seen on the wing. Sept. 2nd, all left,
both young and old. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>. May 28th to June 2nd,
large numbers of Gulls were seen all day in the neighbourhood,
along with Guillemots and Razorbills; these birds were probably
not migrating, or even contemplating such a movement, but
wanderers from Flamborough, following the shoals of small fry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">-31-</span>
which approach the Humber about that period. At the Longstone
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 29th, W., weather fine, first Sandwich Tern seen,
and the last seen Sept. 8th. The Arctic Tern was first seen
May 10th; last, Sept. 14th. At the Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>. Sandwich
Terns were seen on May 12th, and the Arctic May 15th, both
species leaving together on Aug. 28th. The Siberian Herring
Gull, <i>Larus affinis</i>, was seen at Heligoland on June 5th, and the
Caspian Tern, <i>Sterna Caspia</i>, on the 22nd, the first Mr. G&auml;tke
has got there. July 23rd, repeatedly seen.</p>

<h4 id="GENERAL_SUMMARY_SPRING_MIGRATION">GENERAL SUMMARY SPRING MIGRATION.</h4>

<p>Compared with the autumn notes on migration, the spring
reports are very meagre, and few and far between. This is
probably due to the fact that in the spring birds migrate, with
rare exceptions, at night; and, as the weather is then finer, and
the nights clearer and shorter, they do not run their heads so
much against the lanterns of lighthouses and lightships. The
spring migration is also carried on much more leisurely, migrants
proceeding by easy stages northward, and we have none of those
great rushes which are so characteristic of the autumn migration,
when, with sudden changes of weather, flock after flock pour
continually during the whole day and night on to our east coast.
In the spring also the males of the Insessores migrate some time
in advance of the females, as is very clearly shown in the
Heligoland notes, as well as by the well-known arrival of our
summer immigrants, as the Nightingale, Whitethroat, &amp;c. The
notes on spring migration taken in 1879, as well as in 1880, seem
to point to the conclusion that, during the vernal migration,
migrants strike the lanterns of lighthouses from 11 p.m. to the
dawn of day, the majority after midnight; and not in the early
hours of night, as is the case in the autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White-tailed Eagle</span>, <i>Hali&aelig;etus albicilla</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland,
Sept. 10th, S.S.E., windy, eight or ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peregrine Falcon</span>, <i>Falco peregrinus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct.
24th, "all latter time and <i>F. &aelig;salon</i>, scattered." As in every
autumn a few on passage have been recorded in the eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span>
counties; one, an immature male, was shot near Spurn on
Jan. 1st, 1881.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hobby</span>, <i>Falco subbuteo</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, June 19th and 20th,
S.E., some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kestrel</span>, <i>Falco tinnunculus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 25th, S.,
very little wind, a great many, few old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sparrowhawk</span>, <i>Accipiter nisus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, enormous
numbers crossed in the autumn, commencing Aug. 7th, eight
or ten young birds; from thence to Sept. 18th, almost daily in
greater or less numbers, all young birds. Sept. 29th, evening,
the first old birds. Oct. 9th, young interspersed with old;
20th, many; 28th, still daily. An enormous majority of these
must pass down the European coast, as the notices on our
east coast are few and far between. At the Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 8th, one at sunset flying round lantern. At Leman and
Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 6th, 4.30 p.m., one to S.E. At Corton, <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 9th, one settled on ship. At Heligoland, Mr. G&auml;tke says
Sparrowhawks often arrive towards evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Buzzard</span>, <i>Buteo vulgaris</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 18th,
many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honey Buzzard</span>, <i>Pernis apivorus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 10th,
with Sparrowhawks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rough-legged Buzzard</span>, <i>Buteo lagopus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, June
19th and 20th, some. There was a considerable flight on to the
east coast in October, Mr. J. H. Gurney recording (Zool., 1880,
p. 570) about a dozen in Norfolk between Oct. 16th and the end
of the month. Two were shot Nov. 1st on the Lincolnshire coast
near Mabblethorpe, and one at Spurn later in the season.
Several others have been recorded from time to time in the
'Field' and local papers, as either seen or obtained in various
parts of England and Scotland. The following notices from the
lighthouses may or may not refer to this species. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
July 24th, 9 a.m., a large Hawk going S. At Hasbro' <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct.
24th, 11 a.m., four very large birds with heavy flight to S. At
Kentish Knock, <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 13th, one very large Hawk soaring
overhead. At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 19th, a large brown Hawk
about ship&mdash;may perhaps have been a female Kestrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hen Harrier</span>, <i>Circus cyaneus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 20th,
some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long-eared Owl</span>, <i>Asio otus</i>,&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 22nd, some.

At Spurn, Oct. 28th, one shot. At Hasbro' <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 30th,
10 a.m., o.m. from E. to S.W., horned owl&mdash;probably this
species. The Long-eared Owls arrive on our east coast, as a
rule, later than <i>Asio accipitrinus</i>, and in much less numbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short-eared Owl</span>, <i>Asio accipitrinus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept.
25th, S., very little wind, great many. Oct. 20th, again great
many; 22nd, thousands. On our east coast they arrived in very
considerable numbers in October. At Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Nov.
16th, 4 p.m., one. At Coquet Island <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 7th to Nov. 16th,

Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 4th, 7.30 a.m., one N.E. to S.W. At
Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th, noon, one to W.; 23rd, 10.20 a.m., one
to S.W. At Lynn Well <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th, 11 a.m., one; 4 p.m., one
Grey Owl N.W. to S. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 1st, one
caught at noon. Many also arrived about Oct. 19th on the
Norfolk coast. I have no notices of Short-eared Owls south of
Yarmouth. The "great rush" took place on night of Oct. 18th
or morning of 19th, the Woodcock arriving at the same time with
a north wind. Heavy snow from north on Oct. 20th. The
"great rush" over Heligoland was on Oct. 22nd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barn Owl</span>, <i>Aluco flammeus</i>.&mdash;At Yarmouth, Oct. 19th,
morning, one seen coming in from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tengmalm's Owl</span>, <i>Nyctala Tengmalmi</i>.&mdash;On Oct. 22nd a very
fine example of this small Owl was shot at Saltfleet, on the
Lincolnshire coast; wind strong from the north on 21st.
Another was shot in Felyingdales, Yorkshire, near Robin Hood's
Bay, late in December. At Heligoland, Nov. 22nd and 23rd,
Hawk Owl, <i>Surnia funerea</i>, was seen flying about, but never
within shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Grey Shrike</span>, <i>Lanius excubitor</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct.
14th, N.W., windy, four fine old birds, pure white underneath;
16th, some; 17th, some; major, one. Nov. 10th, one fine old
male. There was a very considerable immigration on to the east
coast in October. At Spurn, one was seen during the first week
in October, and subsequently in that month and early in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
November, many. The last from that locality I have a note of
was a female, shot at Patrington, Holderness, on Jan. 20th, 1881.
At Whiteley Sands, Northumberland, one early in October. One
shot near Hartlepool Nov. 17th. One at Flamborough Head
first week in October. Mr. J. H. Gurney has also recorded
three shot in Norfolk in October; and many others have been
mentioned in the 'Zoologist' and 'Field' as occurring in various
parts of the country. One also was shot at North Kelsey, in
Lincolnshire, at the end of February.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spotted Flycatcher</span>, <i>Muscicapa grisola</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland,
June 3rd, some; July 13th, some; Aug. 25th, many; Sept. 3rd,

o.m., many with Starlings round lantern.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The term "Flycatcher" seems to be used somewhat indiscriminately
for many of the small insect-catching birds. Some of these in this case are
probably&mdash;as they are associated with Wheatears&mdash;Redstarts. At the Longstone
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, also on the same date, several Redstarts appeared, both species
migrating together and at the same time.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pied Flycatcher</span>, <i>Muscicapa luctuosa</i> (<i>atricapilla</i>, Linn.)&mdash;At

numbers"; 27th, still passing, but in less numbers; Sept. 8th,
many; 13th, great many with others in potato-fields; 26th, less
numerous; 27th, few. From Aug. 11th to end of Sept., about

both all day; Oct. 6th, with Redwings, and on 16th with
Redwings and Fieldfares; 20th, with Blackbirds and Redwings;
22nd, few; altogether, between Sept. 16th and Oct. 22nd, large
numbers crossed the island. On the English side of the North
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">-35-</span>
Sea, Thrushes occurred at twelve stations covering the entire

E. to W., S.E. to N.W. Time over which migration extended
(exclusive of occurrences in December, as probably referring to
local movements caused by severe weather) from Aug. 3rd,
Cromer, to Nov. 26th, Farne Islands, or 126 days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fieldfare</span>, <i>Turdus pilaris</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 16th, N.W.

Great Cotes as referring perhaps to local movement from
outburst of severe weather in the North, the Fieldfares were seen
on their migration, first near Norwich, Sept. 9th and last at

example of <i>Tardus Naumanii</i> (the first that has occurred there),
a young bird, was captured on Oct. 10th; N.E., windy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Lord Lilford (Zool., 1881, p. 24) records the first Ring Ouzel of the
season in North Northamptonshire on Sept. 21st; and two are also recorded
in 'The Zoologist' (1881, p. 26), as seen near Harwich, Oct. 10, 1880.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedgesparrow</span>, <i>Accentor modularis</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 26th,
pretty large numbers, first comers. Oct. 5th, great many in
garden; 8th, great many; 9th, same. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 17th,
very abundant. At Great Cotes, Sept. 21st, in bean-fields near
coast. Not observed at any other stations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redbreast</span>, <i>Erithacus rubecula</i>,&mdash;At Heligoland, from Sept. 9th
to Oct. 9th, great numbers passing over island. At Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 10th and 16th, 10 a.m., one each day. Oct. 23rd, 5 p.m.,
one caught on glass. Dec. 28th, noon, one. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 27th, 10 a.m., a large flock of small birds containing many
Robins remained a few hours and then went S. At Hunstanton
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 5th, one. At Northrepps, Norfolk, Oct. 14th and 15th,
many noticed, evidently immigrants. At Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey,
Aug. 14th, midnight. Redbreasts with many other birds, some
killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">-38-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bluethroat</span>, <i>Ruticilla suecica</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 9th, E.,
fine, several; 17th, N.E., wind, much rain, many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redstart</span>, <i>Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Aug. 12th
and 13th, young birds. Sept. 3rd, 11 a.m., N.W., great many;
8th, many; 9th, great many; 16th, many, about half old birds;
17th, enormous numbers, same; 25th and 26th, many. At
Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 15th, several on reef. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 15th, many "fly-catchers" with Wheatears (see notes, Flycatcher,
<i>M. grisola</i>). At Teesmouth, many amongst the bents
which grow upon the Tees breakwater early in September (not
previously noted in this locality). At Flamborough, last week in
August, great many. At Spurn, Sept. 3rd, many, left to a bird
night of 3rd. At Northrepps, Aug. 30th and 31st, "swarming." At
Yarmouth, large numbers first week in September. At Shipwash
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 30th, 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., large numbers to W.N.W. The
immigration of this species is very interesting from the large and
unusual numbers which can be traced along the east coast from
the Farne Islands to the Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, off the mouth of the
Thames. They arrived along the entire length of the coast
during the latter part of August and early in September. At the
Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, the most southern station, they were going
W.N.W., and at all other stations, after touching land,
evidently followed the coast-line to the south. The migration
was confined very closely to the coast, the birds going but a short
distance inland. In nearly every case they migrated in company
with or at the same time as the Wheatear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stonechat</span>, <i>Saxicola rubicola</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Aug. 11th,
young. Sept. 3rd, 11 a.m., great many; 9th, same. Oct. 1st,
2nd and 3rd, old birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whinchat</span>, <i>Saxicola rubetra</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Aug. 23rd, great
many young birds, the first of them; 24th, also great many.
October, first week, old birds. Mouth of Deben river, Suffolk
coast, Nov. 1st.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, July 5th, small
flights, young birds; 24th, same. Sept. 16th, great many, about
half old birds. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 10th, several. Sept.
15th, forty to fifty. At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 30th, 10 a.m.,
fog, two came on board. Sept. 10th, great many Wheatears from
S.E., and "several small birds of a dark green colour" (Redstarts?),
some on deck. At Teesmouth, Sept. 10th, an unusually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">-39-</span>
large number along the banks between Hartlepool and Sneaton
Snook, also Redstarts. At Flamborough, last week in August, in
great numbers, with Redstarts. At Spurn, Sept. 3rd, with some
Redstarts. Oct. 27th, last seen, an old bird. At Great Cotes,
September, first fortnight, very great many. At Northrepps,
Aug. 30th and 31st, great numbers and Redstarts. Altogether
there was a very large immigration on the east coast from the
Farne Islands to Yarmouth the last week in August and early in
September.</p>

<p><i>Saxicola deserti</i>, Rupp.,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a fine old male, in perfect summer
plumage, occurred at Heligoland on June 23rd, wind W., calm,
warm. <i>Saxicola leucura</i>, Aug. 11th, E., fine, one, undoubtedly,
but not shot.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> It is worthy of note that on the same day a fine example of <i>Papilio
podalirius</i>, the scarce Swallow-tail, was taken on the island. This butterfly
was added to the British list on the authority of Haworth, but no authenticated
British specimen is known: its occurrence on Heligoland adds to the
probability of its capture in England, [<i>Saxicola deserti</i> also occurred at
Alloa, in Scotland, on Nov. 28th, 1880.&mdash;J.A.H.B.]</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylviid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of the small warblers, <i>Hypolais icterina</i>, a fine
male occurred in Heligoland on June 3rd; the same day some
Willow Wrens and one <i>Sylvia viridanus</i>, a fine female, shot in
Mr. G&auml;tke's garden, making the third Heligoland example. On
July 13th, Whitethroats; 24th, young Willow Wrens. On Aug.
24th, great many, also some Whitethroats and Garden Warblers;
27th, Willow Wrens in less numbers, and again in increased
numbers on Sept. 3rd; on the 9th Chiffchaffs commenced
migrating, also a great many Willow Wrens and Whitethroats
came; on the 15th, forenoon, Willow Wrens and Sedge Warblers,
great many in potato-fields; again, on 16th, S.E., calm, sunny,
warm, Willow Wrens, Chiffchaffs and Garden Warblers, great
many, less numbers of Blackcaps; 17th, Willow Wrens, Chiffchaffs
and Garden Warblers, less of the latter; 25th, westerly.
Willow Wrens, and great numbers of Chiffchaffs, Garden Warblers,
Blackcaps and Whitethroats; the same day, <i>P. superciliosus</i>,
one fine bird shot; besides this a large <i>Phylloscopus</i>, with very
conspicuous wing-bar, was seen. Again, on the 26th, another
<i>P. superciliosus</i>, and in the evening many Chiffchaffs, Garden
Warblers and Blackcaps; 27th, Chiffchaffs, Garden Warblers,
Blackcaps and Whitethroats; 28th, some Chiffchaffs; 30th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span>
Chiffchaffs, Garden Warblers, one <i>P. superciliosus</i> seen, a grey
<i>Phylloscopus</i> seen, <i>tristis ?</i> Some more Chiffchaffs, with many
other birds, Oct. 8th, and one <i>P. superciliosus</i>; Chiffchaffs again
on 9th, 10th and 11th; 13th, Willow Wrens, great numbers all
this latter time also. After the middle of October the migration
of the <i>Sylviid&aelig;</i> appears to have ceased. At Flamborough a
Willow Wren was caught on the morning after the great storm
on the night of Oct. 28th, and at Spurn on morning of 28th a
female Blackcap was shot by Mr. W. Eagle Clarke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden-crested Wren</span>, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland,
Sept. 9th, great many, first comers; 25th, some; 27th, 29th and

Island, Nov. 9th. Migration extending over eighty-eight days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren</span>, <i>Troglodytes parvulus</i>.&mdash;At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Nov. 23rd,
several. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 27th, 10 a.m., Wrens with many
other small birds, remaining a few hours and then going south.
At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 21st, one caught on lantern. At Great Cotes,
early in October, many. At East Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 10 a.m., four
from N.W. came on board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Oct. 14th, N.W., windy. Great Titmouse (<i>Parus
major</i>), some; Blue Titmouse (<i>P. c&aelig;ruleus</i>), a great many passed
over in the afternoon of Oct. 10th, N.E., windy; and again a great
many on the 11th, under the same conditions. At Great Cotes,
Oct. 14th, Great Tit, many; Blue, some; and Coal Titmouse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span>
(<i>Parus ater</i>), a few. Dec. 9th, <i>P. major</i>, several, "second rush."
Migratory flocks of the Long-tailed Titmouse (<i>Acredula rosea</i>)
occurred near Cromer in October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Heligoland, Aug. 27th, Blue-headed and
White Wagtails (<i>Motacilla flava</i> and <i>alba</i>), great many young
birds. Sept. 1st, <i>M. flava</i>, pretty large numbers with other birds,
all restless, passing over; 9th, E., fine. Yellow Wagtail, <i>Budytes</i>
(<i>M. Raii</i>), great many; 15th, forenoon, <i>M. flava</i>, astounding
numbers, late in afternoon in great flights overhead, going north
to south; 27th, <i>M. alba</i>, some. The only migration of Wagtails
over Heligoland in August and September, with one exception,
appears to have been confined to these two well-known European
species&mdash;the Blue-headed and White Wagtails of the Continent.
The Grey Wagtail (<i>M. sulphurea</i>) was first observed at Great
Cotes first week in October, and on Norfolk Coast, Sept. 25th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree Pipit</span>, <i>Anthus trivialis</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Aug. 22nd, young
birds; 23rd, same; 24th, same, but less numbers; 26th, Meadow
Pipit (<i>A. pratensis</i>), great many (oftentimes with smart breeze),
also many Tree Pipits; 31st, Richard's Pipit (<i>A. Richardi</i>), one.

and Meadow Pipits, great many, and two <i>A. Richardi</i> seen; 15th,
forenoon, Richard's Pipit, some, once seven together, none shot;
late in afternoon. Meadow Pipits, great flights. Tree Pipits less;
16th, Tawny Pipit (<i>A. campestris</i>), two; 27th, Meadow Pipits,
a few. Oct. 6th, Meadow Pipits with Larks in great flights passing
overhead. At Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, October, 9 a.m., half a score Titlarks.
At Spurn, Sept. 6th, migrating with Swallows, but in separate
flocks, bents full of Titlarks arriving from sea, came from N.E.,
wind W. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 13th, Titlarks, numbers
on board, fifteen caught. At Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 29th, 6 p.m.,
two Titlarks and six species of small birds on board, left for W.
At Casquets <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 18th, 2 a.m., about fifty struck. Sept. 6th,
midnight to 3 a.m., twenty struck. Rock Pipit (<i>A. obscurus</i>),
Sept. 28th, first seen on Lincolnshire coast; Sept. 22nd, on
Norfolk coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shore Lark</span>, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 4th, about
twenty; 5th and 6th, some; 17th, twenty to forty; 19th, great
many; 20th, flights from twenty to one hundred; 21st, great
many; 23rd, still larger flights; 26th, a few. Also great numbers
in November and up to Dec. 18th; on Nov. 15th, thousands, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">-42-</span>
flights of hundreds. On the English coast the occurrences of the
Shore Lark have been numerous. At Farne Islands, one shot in
the autumn. At Scarborough, Mr. Roberts states that since the
severe weather in January, 1881, Shore Larks in small flocks have
visited the coast, and several have been shot and taken to him.
At Spurn, Dec. 12th, flock of thirteen seen. My informant, who
is well acquainted with the bird, says, "resting apparently as
I was within six yards of them." At Skegness, Lincolnshire coast,
last week in October, eight shot. Near Bedford, Oct. 28th, several
seen, two shot ('Field,' Nov. 6, 1880). On Norfolk coast a flock
at Blakeney, which remained near the place for two months, and
others near Yarmouth. At Dover two procured in December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sky Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;The entrances of the migration
of the Sky Lark at the East Coast stations are far too numerous
to note separately. In many cases they occupy a large portion
of the returned schedules, and individually far outnumber any
other species. At Heligoland the migration commenced Sept. 25th,
already great many overhead; 27th, 9 to 10 p.m., passing. Oct. 5th,
morning, great many; 6th, afternoon, great flights overhead;
19th, late in forenoon, great flights passing on; 20th, with Starlings,
hundreds of thousands passing overhead and over the sea;
21st, same; 27th considerable passage in the night; 28th, many
thousands over the sea; and after this in flights through November
and December. On our East Coast they are noticed at thirty-one
of the stations making returns, from the Farne Islands to the
Casquets, Alderney. At Farne Island <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 30th to Oct. 31st.
At Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Dec. 19th. At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 25th
to Nov. 21st. On Oct. 24th, all day, "great rush." Nov. 21st,
"second rush." At Teesmouth, Oct. 6th to 30th. At Whitby
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 14th to Nov. 23rd. At Flamborough in October. At
Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 15th to Jan. 13th. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 6th to
27th&mdash;from 9th to 15th every day continuous. At Great Cotes,

Well <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th to 23rd, on seven days great numbers; 11th,
12th and 13th, continuous during day ("great rush"); after this,
from Oct. 23rd to Jan. 3rd, in less numbers. On Jan. 1st, 2nd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">-43-</span>
and 3rd, with Knot; sixteen Larks and fifteen Knots killed against
lantern. At Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 8th, great many. At Cromer

Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 9th to Nov. 11th, on seventeen days in large
flocks, up to five hundred in a flock; Oct. 31st, 11 p.m., half a

number, and many on night of 6th, with other birds. At Kentish
Knock <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, only on Oct. 17th. At Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 18th,

numbers crossed at these four Goodwin Stations. At Casquets
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 2nd, 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., sixty killed.</p>

<p>The migration of the Lark was carried on all hours of day and
night in all weathers from Aug. 27th to Jan. 12th. The "great
rush" took place during the last fortnight in October, more
crossing probably on the 22nd than any other day, and at Heligoland
on 20th and 21st. A "second rush" a month later, on or
about Nov. 21st, and a "third rush" on the outbreak of severe
weather in the second week in January this year. General line
of direction E. to W., sometimes N.E. to S.W., but generally, like
the majority of immigrants this season, with a strong trend from
points south of east. It is remarkable, as shown by the returns,
how frequently Larks are associated in migration with Starlings,
either in separate flocks or together; in fact, the two species
seem to be inseparable. In a large majority of instances these
two meadow-feeders are associated as if impelled to migrate by a
common cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wood Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arborea</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 28th,
four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">-44-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting</span>, <i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept.
17th, a few first arrivals; Oct. 20th, great many; 20th and 26th,
a few; Nov. 20th, still great numbers, but very few old birds.
At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 28th to Dec. 20th; "rush," Nov. 16th,
and again Dec. 20th. At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, from Nov. 7th
to the end of month, nearly on every day, immense numbers
passed; all came from N., and were going S.W. At Flamborough,
Oct. 8th, first seen; Jan. 13th, great many flocks. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
third week in October, a few; 29th, many, after great gale from
E. and N.E. At Great Cotes, early in November,&mdash;1st to 5th,&mdash;many;
24th, enormous flocks. At Yarmouth, middle of October.
At Harwich, Oct. 30th, many in Orwell river; Nov. 4th, first
flock seen near Dovercourt (Zool., 1881, p. 26). None are recorded
from stations south of Harwich. The flocks consisted mainly of
the young of the year and old females; very few old male birds.
The immigration of Snow Buntings on to the north-easterly
coasts in four distinct rushes, <i>viz.</i>, at the end of October, in
November, December, and January, has been attended with
corresponding depressions of the barometer and outbursts of
Arctic weather, <i>viz.</i>, the great gale E. to N.E., Oct. 28th, with
heavy snow in Scotland; Nov. 18th to 20th, sharp frosts and
heavy snow-storms; Dec. 14th and 15th, the same; and Jan.
11th and 12th, same. Mr. G&auml;tke has observed for some years a
very marked decrease in the number of Snow Buntings crossing
Heligoland. There has been a very great increase in the number
arriving on our east coast for the last six or seven winters, and it
is probable that, like the Shore Lark and other Arctic birds, the
line of migration now runs further to the west than formerly.</p>

<p>Other <i>Emberizin&aelig;</i> occurred as follows:&mdash;At Heligoland,
Oct. 11th, Ortolan Bunting, <i>Emberiza hortulana</i>, many young;
24th, same; Sept. 1st, pretty large numbers; 8th and 9th,
many; 15th, great many in potato-lands; 29th, Reed Bunting,
<i>E. sch&#339;niclus</i>, many; Oct. 4th, great many; 6th, same;
8th, great many; 11th, same. Yellow Bunting, <i>E. citrinella</i>,
28th, many; and same and Corn Buntings up to Nov. 20th, few
old birds. Little Bunting, <i>E. pusilla</i>, Sept. 26th, one; 30th,
one; Oct. 11th, one. On the east coast of England, at Great
Cotes, Sept. 30th, <i>E. sch&#339;niclus</i>, many. At Spurn, Oct. 26th, a
few seen. At South-sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 29th, four to south.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span>, <i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 17th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">-45-</span>
great many beginning to pass; 25th, enormous numbers passing
on high overhead in a westerly direction; 26th, hundreds of
thousands high overhead; 27th, some; 28th, thousands so high
overhead that they cannot be seen, only their call-notes heard,
all day long; Oct. 6th, 7th, and 8th, great many; 11th, same;
27th, still many passing. Great numbers have also arrived on
the east coast; they are noticed at fourteen stations, from the
Farne Islands to the Goodwins. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 1st,
2 a.m., one killed against glass, S.W., misty. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 27th, "Finches," "great rush," with many other species.
At Great Cotes, Oct. 13th, very large flocks of females and young
of the year about this date. At Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 16th, one male
caught on deck; 28th, same; Dec. 5th, one same, going W. At
Lynn Well <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th and 23rd, many S.E. to N.W.; 25th, in
smaller flocks to N.W. At Northrepps, Oct. 13th, Mr. J. H. Gurney
saw a huge flock in a stubble-field on the cliff, which he thinks must
have come in from the sea. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 19th, 8 to
12 p.m., o.m., six caught on deck. At Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 2 to 3 p.m.,
Oct. 6th, 14th, and 18th, each day to S.W. At Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct.
6th, two on board caught. At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 7 p.m., several
males alighted on deck; 15th, 6 p.m., one male caught. At
Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 9th to Nov. 6th, on several days, sometimes
with Larks, twelve Larks, nine Chaffinches killed night of Oct.
9th, o.m., heavy rain. At Kentish Knock <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 7th, two at
sunrise to S.W.; 15th, two, male and female, caught; 17th,
W.S.W., three or four hundred very high to S.W. At Swin

Linnets to W. At Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 28th, 9 to 11 a.m., continuous
flocks of Linnets, Starlings, Chaffinches, and Mountain Sparrows
to W., many of each on deck. The main immigration of the
Chaffinch was from the middle of September to end of October,
the bulk of the immigrants crossing south of Yarmouth. The
"great rush" on or about Oct. 13th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brambling</span>, <i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept.
25th, many; 27th, some; Oct. 8th, great many; and on 27th,
still more, and also good many throughout November. On the
English coast few have been observed. At Flamborough, Jan.
13th, some large flocks. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 6th, one
male caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer montanus</i>.&mdash;None are recorded as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span>
passing Heligoland. On our east coast they were observed at
eleven stations, but none are recorded north of Spurn. In
North-east Lincolnshire, Oct. 13th, very large flocks were seen
about this date. At Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th, "Sparrows" to W.
At Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 25th, six going W. by N. At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 7th, several alighted on ship for a short time, going E. to W.
At Kentish Knock <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 9th, seven on board till squall had
passed. At Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 28th, flocks to N.N.W. At
Tongue <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 28th, 11 a.m., o.m., about one hundred
Sparrows on masthead; Oct. 24th, twenty to W. at noon. At
North Foreland <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, from October to third week in December,
hundreds "mixed" were seen. At Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 28th to
Nov. 5th, on five days, often with Larks to W. At Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Sept. 28th, continuous with other birds from 9 to 11 a.m. to W.;
Oct. 16th, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., continuous to W. At East
Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 25th, Oct. 9th, and 11th, flocks flying about
ship; 17th, flock from N.W. to S.E.; Jan. 8th, about one
hundred from W. to E. towards French coast. From Sept. 25th
to Nov. 28th, the majority passing across at the most southern
stations the four lightships on the Goodwin Sands. It is possible
that some of the entries of "Sparrows," where not distinctly
specified, may refer to the Common Sparrow, which is now
recognised as a regular immigrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">House Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer domesticus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Mr.
G&auml;tke says, "Up towards the end of July all young Sparrows
disappeared from the island," and "up to middle of September
nearly all old Sparrows had also quitted the island." Oct. 10th,
"Sparrows latterly influx," from which it appears that the local
Sparrows leave, the young first, then the old, and their place is
taken by a fresh arrival. At Spurn, last week in Nov., Mr.
Hewetson saw an immense flock&mdash;hundreds upon hundreds&mdash;on
the shore, evidently quite fresh arrivals; amongst them was
a Reed Bunting. At Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 26th, 5 p.m.,
twenty House Sparrows came on board, travelling from S.E. to
N.W.; and on Oct. 2nd, at 4 p.m., eight going E.S.E. to W.
At Kentish Knock <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 10th, one Common Sparrow; and on
12th, two, till squall had passed, then to S.W. At Casquets <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Alderney, Oct. 13th to 17th, at midnight, Common Sparrows
with Thrushes, Blackbirds, Starlings, and Wood Pigeons, to
English coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">-47-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenfinch</span>, <i>Coccothraustes chloris</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 27th,
many; Nov. 20th, great many. At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 31st, one,
a male, caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldfinch</span>, <i>Carduelis elegans</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 27th,
some; also through November and December; on Dec. 17th,
great many. At Great Cotes, some small flocks in North-east
Lincolnshire in October and November, more than have been
seen for many years. On Suffolk coast, mouth of Deben, Nov.
1st, seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Siskin</span>, <i>Carduelis spinus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 16th, a.m.,
"flights in my garden of (say) fifty; p.m., flights of hundreds";
17th, "hundreds of thousands"&mdash;"flights like clouds"; 25th,
many; Oct. 7th, great many; 27th, many still passing; Nov.
4th, W., still some flights. On English coast of Spurn, Oct.
27th, small flock seen. At Northrepps, Sept. 16th, seen by Mr.
J. H. Gurney. Have also been reported as more plentiful than
usual in other parts of country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lesser Redpole</span>, <i>Linota rufescens</i>.&mdash;In Lincolnshire there
were very considerable numbers in our east coast marshes early
in October; in one instance, on the 7th, I saw a flock of two
hundred in a stubble-field near the coast. At Spurn, Oct. 28th,
Mr. Wm. Eagle Clarke saw a flock near Kilnsea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span>, <i>Linota cannabina</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 4th, great
many, first comers; 6th, some; 28th, with Twites, great many.
On the English coast, Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 27th, with many others.
At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 5th, one E. to W. At Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Sept. 18th, sunrise to 10 a.m., with Chaffinches to W.; and on
previous day, Sept. 17th, all day to N.N.W. with Swallows. At
Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 26th to Oct. 25th, on six days with other birds to
W. and S.W.; continuous all day on Oct. 24th and 25th. At
South-sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 18th and 21st, Linnets with others
all day; 26th, all day with others to W. and N.W. Immense
numbers appear to have crossed from Oct. 1st to 26th at the
stations off the Essex and Kent coasts; none, or very few only,
at stations north of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twite</span>, <i>Linota flavirostris</i>.&mdash;Is not recorded on the English
coast. At Heligoland, Oct. 16th, many passed, first comers;
and on 17th, great many; 20th, great many; and on 25th, 26th,
and 27th, lesser flights; 28th, many with Linnets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bullfinch</span>, <i>Pyrrhula europ&aelig;a</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 7th, one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">-48-</span>
young; 8th, one, young, in garden; 10th, some; 11th, a few;
19th, some; 25th, a few; and through November and December
in small parties of ten to twelve; have not been seen on the
island for ever so many years. At Spurn, some were seen last
week in November; and during the last fortnight in the same
month, many in North-east Lincolnshire. Mr. J. H. Gurney,
writing from Reigate, Jan. 4th, 1881, says, "There are more
Bullfinches in this part of Surrey than I think I ever saw."
Extraordinary numbers were seen in Mayo and Sligo, Ireland, in
the last autumn and winter (See 'Zoologist,' 1881, p. 133).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crossbill</span>, <i>Loxia curvirostra</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Oct. 7th, one
young bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;Next to the Lark, this species
undoubtedly takes the second rank numerically amongst the
migrants. The young birds crossed Heligoland in large numbers
from June 15th to July 5th. The old birds beginning to move
about Sept. 11th, and from that time to Oct. 27th, enormous
numbers passed. On the English coast they are recorded at
twenty-five stations, from the Longstone to the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Guernsey. At Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Nov. 19th, large flocks to W.
At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 30th, to Nov. 13th (Oct. 15th, rush),
when they passed all day westward. At Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 1st
and 11th. At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 27th, large flocks
from S.E. to N.W. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, July 23rd, one hundred
young birds to S. At Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, great numbers in
November. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 14th to Nov. 27th, Oct. 23rd and
24th, and Nov. 27th to 30th, all day from N. to S. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 17th, thirty came on board; 27th, Starlings and Larks; two
dozen caught going S. At Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Jan. 4th, one
dead on deck at sunrise. At Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 8th, 4 a.m.,
o.m., rain, E., hundreds with Larks round light, fifteen killed.
At Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Jan. 3rd, 1881, 3 a.m., one killed. At Leman
and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 28th and 29th, and Oct. 19th, during night;
At Hasboro' <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 13th and 14th, 11 p.m. to midnight, with
Larks, twenty stunned, young birds; 27th, midnight, four killed,
young; Dec. 27th, midnight, with Larks and Blackbirds. At
Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 13th to 25th, on three days to W. At Corton
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 27th, Oct. 4th, and Nov. 17th, E. to W. At Galloper
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 13th to Nov. 11th, nearly every day large flocks going
N.W., day and night, sometimes alone, at others with Larks and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">-49-</span>
small birds. At Kentish Knock <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 8th, 10th, and 13th,
to W.S.W., with Larks and many other birds. At Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Sept. 21st to Nov. 23rd, on several days, sometimes with Larks
N. and N.W. At Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 28th, flocks to W. with
other birds; and Oct. 30th, to W. with Larks. At South-sand
Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 10th, continuous with others; also on 17th, 18th,
22nd, and 26th, to W. At East Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 24th and
25th, hazy, flocks about ship with Sparrows on 25th; Oct. 16th,
hundreds E. to W. At Casquets <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 13th to 17th,
midnight, rain. Starlings amongst other birds to N.W. At
Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, Aug. 14th, night, with many others;
Dec. 2nd, midnight, o.m., half a dozen struck. The young
migrate first; the old in October and November. Have
crossed in the greatest number at the more southern stations,
travelling all hours of the day and night in westerly and north-westerly
directions; constantly associated with Larks in their
migrations. The majority crossed from Oct. 19th to 26th. Again
there was a "second rush" near the end of November, and a
third the second week in January, before the outbreak of severe
weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose-coloured Starling</span>, <i>Pastor roseus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland,
Sept. 17th, one, a young bird, occurred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey Crow</span>, <i>Corvus cornix</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 24th,
commencing with flocks of thirty to forty, and passing at
intervals to end of October, sometimes in immense numbers;
Oct. 7th, towards evening an enormous flight, during night fifty
caught by lanterns; and after this passing in smaller numbers
to Nov. 2nd. On the English coast they were noticed at seventeen
stations, extending from the Farne Islands to the mouth of
the Thames. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 21st to Nov. 20th, to W.
At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 10th, two E. to W.; Oct. 12th,
great many E.S.E. to W.N.W. At Teesmouth, Sept. 25th, two
seen; Oct. 16th and 20th, many. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 24th and
26th, with Blackbirds at daylight. At Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct.
8th, enormous numbers seen. At Spurn, Oct. 12th to Nov. 9th,
great many. At Great Cotes, Oct. 9th, 5.30 p.m., gale from N.E.,
large flock came in, travelling from E. to W., very high. At
Lynn Well, <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 10th to 14th, continuous every day from S.
to N.W.; again 22nd and 23rd, all day S.E. to N.W. At
Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 10th, 11th, and 12th, many E. to W.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span>
wind E.N.E. At Northrepps, Oct. 13th, many to N.W. At
Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 21st, 5 p.m., to N.W. At Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 11th, continuous to W.N.W., and E.N.E. At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 10th, very high, E. to W., wind E.N.E.; 11th, continuous
9 a.m. to noon. At mouth of Deben, Oct. 29th to Nov. 1st, in
numbers. At Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 24th to Nov. 9th, many flocks.
At Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 12th, 30th, and Nov. 3rd, flocks N.W. and
N.N.W. At Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 22nd, noon to 3 p.m., with
Rooks. At South-sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 16th, ten "Crows" to
N.W.&mdash;may have been <i>Corvus corone</i>; Nov. 4th, two hundred
Crows to N.W. The majority of the Hooded Crows arrived from
Oct. 8th to 23rd, the greatest number on any given day probably
on the 11th. The main body passed on to the east coast between
Flamborough and Yarmouth, with northerly and easterly winds,
and travelling from E. to W., N.E. to S.W., and S.E. and S.
to N.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rook</span>, <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>.&mdash;Enormous as have been the number
of Crows crossing the North Sea the Rook has probably quite
equalled them. None were noticed at Heligoland, or indeed at
any station north of the Humber; but from Spurn to the Southsand
Head they are recorded at sixteen stations, from Oct. 10th
to Nov. 12th, the greatest number crossing undoubtedly on Oct.
21st, and the majority during the autumn at the more southern
stations. Comparing the immigration of the Grey Crow with the
Rook we find that the former crossed more to the north than the
latter did. Thus Grey Crows are recorded from the Farnes to
the mouth of the Thames: the majority into Holderness, Lincolnshire
and Norfolk; the Rooks from Spurn to the South Foreland,
the majority into the southern counties. Each, however, came
from, and travelled to, the same points of the compass&mdash;E. to
W., or N.E. to S.W., or S.E. and S. to S.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daw</span>, <i>Corvus monedula</i>.&mdash;At Great Cotes, Oct. 19th, several,
with Rooks, coming in from the sea. At Northrepps, Oct. 14th,
going N.W. At Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 17th, 7.45 a.m., Rooks and
Daws, three to four hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jay</span>, <i>Garrulus glandarius</i>.&mdash;Nil Return. There was, however,
a considerable influx into North-east Lincolnshire on or about
the last week in October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pie</span>, <i>Pica rustica</i>.&mdash;At Northrepps, Oct. 17th, Mr. J. H.
Gurney observed two high up, going E.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">-51-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallow</span>, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 16th,
passing S. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 1st, several all day. At
Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, July 10th, numbers; Sept. 20th, 6 p.m., four. At
Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, July 27th, 6 to 7.30 p.m., wind S.W.,
moderate, six large flocks, fifty to sixty each, north to south;
Sept. 15th, 4 p.m., large flocks to S. At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 22nd,
4 p.m., last seen going S. At Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 17th,
midday, great many. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 6th, all day young
Swallows passing along Spurn promontory towards S., each flock
followed by Pipits. At Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 28th, large flock
on lighthouse. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, July 29th, 6 a.m.,
numbers passed, some alighting on board, one struck and killed.
At Hasboro' <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 1st, 2 a.m., fog, flock, several caught as
they beat against lantern. At Winterton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 3rd to 9th,
round lantern every day. At Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 15th, all
day to N.W.; 17th, with Linnets all day to N.N.W.; 18th,
sunrise to 9 a.m., two hundred to W. At North Foreland <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
July 28th, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., passing; 29th, six passed; Swallows
also in numbers from five to forty were seen flying round lantern
during the last week in September. At South-sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Sept. 23rd, twelve to W, At Casquets <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 7th, from
11 p.m. to 3 a.m., S.S.E., rain. Swallows, Landrails, Water
Rails, Woodcocks, King Ouzels, and Common Thrushes were seen
round light; amongst the birds striking the glass were one hundred
Swallows. At Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, Sept. 30th, a flight passed
south. Swallows were noticed migrating at fifteen stations on
the east coast and in the Channel from July 10th, at Coquet
Island, to Oct. 7th, at the Casquets, the greater part in
September. Migrate both by day and night, and in very
considerable flocks; general direction north to south, but at Swin
Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, S.E. to N.W. Swallows remained very late in the
autumn of the past year in some localities. In North-east
Lincolnshire, Nov. 9th, a pair seen. In Essex, Nov. 4th. In
'The Zoologist' for 1881, p. 62, the editor records the late stay
of the Swallow at eight stations, all southern ones except Dublin,
from Nov. 22nd to Dec. 11th. It is rather remarkable that, in
North-east Germany, Swallows are recorded in the German
newspapers as taking their departure nearly a month before the
average time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>, <i>Chelidon urbica</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, Sept. 1st, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">-52-</span>
Swifts passing on overhead, N.W., clear, little wind, warm. At
Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 21st, sunset, two flying round lantern.
At mouth of Deben, Nov. 1st, many Martins and Sand Martins
seen. At South-sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 1st, twelve to S. One
was seen at Henley-on-Thames on Dec. 18th (Zool., 1881, p. 62).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span>, <i>Cypselus apus</i>.&mdash;At Heligoland, June 1st, some
passing; Sept. 1st, passing on overhead; 16th, great many.
At Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 16th, 4 p.m., flock to S. At Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug.
27th, 6.30 a.m., great number to S.; Sept. 6th, again migrating;
on June 7th, at 7 p.m., fifty were seen perched on gallery of

as early as the first week in July, and so on into August. The
old birds later and in separate flocks. The migration of old birds
as seen at Spurn going towards the north is exceptional, the rule
on the east coast being a few old black-breasted birds in August
and September, often with Lapwings, then flocks of young birds,
and later in November the "great rush" of old birds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> My friend Major Seddon, of Waltham, informs me that, when at Spurn
with his yacht, on the night of Aug. 22nd, he saw thousands of Golden
Plover passing north along the sea-shore in detached flocks, flying in lines
and arrow-heads; he was near enough to see that the upper parts were
speckled with the "golden drop," and the under parts mottled black and
white, as if changing from the summer to the winter dress.</p>

birds having black or mottled breasts are often seen in July or
early in August. Some birds of the previous year, or in their
second summer, sometimes remain on the coast during the
summer.</p>

Northern Diver, <i>Columbus glacialis</i>, Nov. 2nd, six "speckled"
about island. At Teesmouth, several Red-throated Divers,
<i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>, early morning. Mr. J. H. Gurney
informs me that when Mr. F. D. Power was off Cley, on
the Norfolk coast, this autumn, on Oct. 1st, he saw a remarkable
flight of Red-throated Divers along coast eastward; they flew
forty to fifty yards high, but rarely came near the boat; one

have taken place in October, from N. to S. along the east coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Heligoland, July, Caspian Tern, <i>Sterna Caspia</i>,
frequently seen. At Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 28th, both the

Sandwich and Arctic Terns left the islands. At the Longstone
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, on the extreme outer reef of the Farnes, the Sandwich Tern
was seen last on Sept. 8th, and the Arctic Sept. 14th. At
Coquet Island <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 14th, N.N.E., great number of Terns all

At Filey, Ivory Gull, <i>Larus eburnea</i>, a fully mature example, a
male, was shot in September; a young bird in the spotted
plumage was also obtained in the same month. At Flamborough,
Sept. 5th to 6th, Lesser Black-backed Gulls to south all day;
wind S.W. by W.; equal proportion of young and old. At Spurn

large numbers of Gulls continuous to south. At Lynn Well <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Aug. 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, great quantities all day from S.E. At
Yarmouth, Mr. J. H. Gurney, writing Jan. 26th, 1881, says,
"A correspondent at Yarmouth had recently twenty-seven
Glaucous Gulls in the flesh, seven of which were mature." At
Hasboro' <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Dec. 18th, 8 p.m., "Little Gull" struck and broke
its neck. At Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 16th, Gulls during day; 27th,
same. At Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 29th, 10 a.m., large numbers to

<p><span class="smcap">Stercorariin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Teesmouth 5 Buoy <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 29th, two
Skuas passed. At Redcar, Sept. 16th, twenty Richardson's Skuas
passed; Oct. 28th, Mr. T. H. Nelson, writing in the 'Field'
newspaper for Nov. 6th, 1880, states that, during the night of
the storm on Oct. 28th, he saw considerable numbers of the
Pomatorhine Skua, amounting to several hundreds, flying close
to the esplanade at Redcar, and struggling to make headway
against the gale; they consisted almost entirely of mature birds
of the white-breasted variety, only three or four being dark birds,
but whether immature or adult he could not ascertain. At
Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Aug. 1st to Sept. 24th, a few Skuas passed going S.;
Oct. 1st to 16th, many passed same direction. At South-sand

one Petrel caught against glass of lantern, examined and set at
liberty. At Redcar, Oct. 28th, two Stormy and one Fulmar
Petrels picked up during great gale. At Flamborough, first week
in October, Stormy Petrel. At Spurn, Oct. 28th, Stormy Petrels

<h3 id="General_Remarks_2"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>The report for 1880 compared with that of the previous year
shows very similar results, as in 1879 a considerable proportion
of the immigrants crossed at the more southern stations, or
at the narrowest portion of the North Sea. If we divide the east
coast into three divisions, one north-easterly from the Farne
Islands to the Humber, mid-east from the Humber to Yarmouth,
and south-eastern forward to the South Foreland, we find that in
1879 the main body of migrants passed in the south-eastern
division; in 1880 they have been tolerably equally distributed
over the mid and south-eastern. During the principal month of
migration, October, the wind blew persistently day by day and
week by week from northerly and easterly quarters, and to this
cause we may fairly attribute the deflection of migrants to the
south. In support of this I may quote the letter of Mr. Thos. O.
Hall of the Longstone Lighthouse, who, writing under date Feb.
15th, 1881, says:&mdash;"The chief flight undoubtedly took place on
the 15th and 16th of October, at which time I was on shore. I
have been resident on the Farne Islands thirteen years, and
during that time never remember seeing so few birds as we have
had this autumn. I have remarked that when the flight takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">-63-</span>
place with the wind at E. or N.E., the body of birds is to the
south of us about Whitby and southward."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enormous number of immigrants arriving,
as shown in our returned schedules from each station, we may be
quite certain these returns only represent an almost inappreciable
percentage of the actual number on passage. On days of
uncertain light or on clear fine starlight nights, when migration
is carried on at a considerable height, immense numbers of birds
might pass any station for hours without a chance of observation;
and it is quite possible that, if the whole three hundred miles of
coast were studded with floating posts of observation at the
distance of half a mile, equal average results would have been
obtained, our present stations on the light-vessels affording no
more especial line of advantage than any other imaginary line
drawn across the North Sea. Incredible although it may appear,
we believe that the vast majority of the immigrants coming to us
in the autumn in one broad front from east to west are such as
cross with the intention of remaining the winter in some part or
other of the British Islands, and naturally take the place of our
own resident summer species which have left, or are about
leaving us, for the south.</p>

<p>As in 1879 the main line of migration has been a broad
stream from east to west, and covering the whole of the English
east coast, this is the line mainly followed by the <i>Passeres</i>.
Taking this line as a basis, we find birds also occasionally
coming from points north of east; but in the vast majority of
instances the migration has had a decidedly southerly trend,
coming from points south of east, and even direct from the
southward. Again, there is in the autumn always a steady stream
of migrants which closely follows the coast-line from N. to S.,
composed of birds either moving from more northerly districts of
our islands, or of such immigrants coming from the east as strike
the coast in more northern latitudes and then follow it to the
south. The great wide E. to W. stream of migration is composed
of some few well-known species which regularly come to us in the
autumn, the great body undoubtedly remaining to winter; placed
in order of rotation according to their numerical superiority or
otherwise, we find <i>Alauda arvensis</i>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, <i>Corvus
cornix</i> and <i>frugilegus</i>, the <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, including two native and two
northern species, with sparrows, linnets, and chaffinches compose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">-64-</span>
the bulk of the immigrants. Others, as <i>Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i>, the
<i>Saxicol&aelig;</i>, and other soft-billed insect-eaters, although coming
from the eastward, persistently follow the coast-line to the south.
All the <i>Limicol&aelig;</i> and other shore birds, as well as the Geese,
Ducks, Divers, Gulls, and sea-fowl generally, move from north to
south as a general rule, the sea-fowl at some distance at sea, the
waders along the coast. Although so far we have no stations,
excepting Heligoland, on the European coast of the North Sea,
we may, I think, fairly presume that there is similarly another
stream of birds passing down the coast-line of Europe. Migration
as observed on that island for many years points to the undoubted
fact that the line followed by birds is, as a rule, from E. to W.,
and doubtless some portion of these Heligoland birds keep moving
westward or south-westward, till eventually they strike our east
coast. There are, however, many species which make Heligoland
the western boundary of their autumn wanderings, and crossing,
as they do, that island in enormous numbers, must eventually
follow the coast-line to the south, for the simple reason that they
never occur on our own coast, except as very rare or occasional
wanderers; such are <i>Motacilla alba</i> and <i>flava</i>, <i>Ruticilla suecica</i>,
<i>Emberiza hortulana</i>, <i>Plectrophanes lapponicus</i>, <i>Anthus Richardi</i>,
and, in a less degree, <i>Muscicapa luctuosa</i> and <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>.
These all, then, must pass southward along the European coast,
as do doubtless an immense majority of those countless Sparrowhawks,
Siskins, and more familiar birds which cross the island in
the autumn migration; and just as occasionally some species,
whose line of migration lies farther to the eastward still, turn up
as wanderers to the old rock from the regular track, so do
occasionally now one and now another of the regular Heligoland
immigrants get blown across to one side.</p>

<p>The observations taken at some of our southern stations both
in 1879 and 1880 show that, in the autumn, there is what may
be called a double stream of birds crossing each other near the
entrance of the English Channel, that is, from the Essex and Kent
coast towards the S.E. on to the French and Belgian coast, and
again in the opposite direction from the Belgian land to the coast of
Kent. During the severe weather in the early part of 1881, as well
as in December, flocks of birds came to us direct from the French
coast, or from the south to the north. These must be considered
purely local migrations, caused by outbursts of severe weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">-65-</span></p>

<p>It is a curious fact that in nearly every case of birds passing
the Casquets <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> in the past autumn, they were travelling in a
N.W. direction, or from the French to the English coast, a line of
migration which does not seem to be in proper accord with what
we should imagine migrating birds would or rather ought to take.
On reference to the chart of the Channel it is apparent that any
flocks leaving the French coast at or near Cape de la Hague, and
crossing. Alderney, when once off the Casquets might as readily
and easily steer for the Start Point on the English side as across
the wide break in the French coast for Port Sillon, each being
about equal distances from the Casquets.</p>

<p>As in 1879 birds have crossed in all hours of the day and
night, and in all winds and weathers, the returns also show, as
did the preceding, that they seldom fly dead to windward, except
with light breezes, and that strong head winds are prejudicial to
their passage. The line of flight mostly adopted is within three
or four points of the wind; they will go on well, even with a beam
wind or some points short of beam, if not too strong. Small birds
have often much difficulty in making head against a strongly-opposing
wind. Mr. John Cutting, writing from the light-vessel
on the Galloper Bank, says, that out of the number of small birds
passing that station in October and November against strong
adverse winds, he could not think they would ever reach land,
they made such very slow progress, the wind being too strong
and the distance from land so great. Even such strong-winged
birds as the Grey Crow do not always cross in safety; I have
been told by an old fen farmer that, many years ago, when a
great gale swept the Lincolnshire coast, at the time the Hooded
Crow crossed, the coast was subsequently strewed with their
bodies cast up by the sea.</p>

<p>Birds are noticed at the stations as sometimes flying high,
sometimes low; often it will be observed with northerly and
easterly winds they will fly high, and with winds in opposite
quarters, low. The state of weather at the time of migration has
more, we think, to do with the height at which birds travel than
the direction of the wind. On clear light nights they travel high,
as a rule, but in fog, and thick murky weather, rain or snow, not
far above the waves. On thick nights, indeed, lost birds will
wheel for hours round a lightship, but with the first break in the
clouds or streak of early dawn are on their course again. At the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span>
Casquets, which is a revolving light, the larger birds follow the
rays, but do not often strike the glass.</p>

<p>With such favourable passages as light head winds afford,
our immigrants are so little fatigued that they will not alight on
reaching land, but keep on their course into the interior. I have
watched for hours flock after flock arriving on the east coast,
coming directly from westward, Rooks, Starlings, Lapwings, and
Snow Buntings, and keeping on in a direct westerly direction as
far as the eye or a good glass were able to follow. Often, too,
when on the hills, miles from the sea, I have seen migrating
flocks passing inland. Larks in straggling flocks, carrolling
cheerily as they pass; there is no bird which migrates so
cheerily and light-heartedly as the Lark, ever ready to burst into
song on the least occasion. At other times, with adverse winds,
I have watched migrants scarce able to struggle on shore dropping
in the first shelter, or even on the bare wind-swept coast. At
Lynn Well light-vessel large numbers of migrants passed day
by day, and for the entire day, during October, from S.E.
or S.S.E., and even S. to N.W. From the position of this
station off Lynn Deeps at the bottom of the Wash, under
the shelter of the north-westerly trend of the coast, these
migrants must have first crossed the northern part of the
county of Norfolk, without alighting, on their way to the fens of
Lincolnshire and Cambridge, and this both by day and night.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Though the dark night is near."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is very remarkable how suddenly the stream of migration
commences running, and how suddenly it stops again. We
watch, at early morning, a flock of Larks or Hooded Crows come
to land; others soon follow, and then for some hours&mdash;it may be
from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.&mdash;there is a constant arrival of migrants;
and then migration, at least for that day, is over, and not a single
wanderer will be seen.</p>

<p>As a rule, the young of the year migrate some weeks in
advance of the old birds; this holds good with all orders and
species. In the spring the males often migrate in advance of
the females.</p>

<p>The time of migration of any particular species extends over
a considerable period; sometimes it is over in four or five weeks,
in other cases going on for months, and even half a year; for,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span>
practically, such birds as the Lark and Starling are migrating all
the year round. In every case the migration of a set species will
continue, day by day, or week by week, till it attains the
maximum by a "great rush," the main body passing, and then
gradually falling off, till the migration of that species is
completed.</p>

<p>Independent of the normal or ordinary migration, we have
frequently local migrations, due to sudden changes of weather, or
in search of fresh feeding-grounds. These "great rushes" of
immigrants, coming helter-skelter on to our east coast, are often
accompanied or followed very closely by outbursts of severe
weather; and a sudden increase of cold in winter will almost
clear a whole district of its birds; in fact, all birds are very
susceptible to changes of weather, and, if closely watched, will
indicate by their movements the coming change. On Jan. 12th,
in this year, when in the Humber marshes, I noticed Larks and
Snow Buntings passing from N. to S. from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
separate flocks for some hours, and after 11 p.m., when the
snow commenced, continuous.</p>

<p>Birds in the early autumn do not, it is evident, migrate for
lack of food, for the young of the <i>Limicol&aelig;</i> are on our coast at a
time when the supply of insect-food in high northern latitudes is
the most abundant; and our own insect-eating birds are often
away long before there is, or can be, any falling off in food. On
the same grounds it is not changes in the seasons which can
induce young birds, having no knowledge from experience, to
return south in the heat of the Arctic latter-summer; as to the
<i>how</i> and the <i>why</i> of the whole matter, we must be content for the
present to say nothing, but continue to collect facts.</p>

<p>In 1880 the main body of the migrants crossed between the
15th and end of October, the greater number perhaps on the 17th
of that month.</p>

is evident that very general interest is being taken in the work.
Altogether, our west coast returns are quite satisfactory, and it
gives us much pleasure to think that the first year's reports have
really interested our obliging correspondents. We hope that the
present general report will succeed in enlisting the whole body in
the service. We can as yet only repeat, that we believe that
interesting and curious results will in time be arrived at; but we
deprecate any attempt at present to arrive at these, desiring first
a firm basis of facts to build upon, which can only be obtained by
continued attention and careful record, for a few years longer, of
a large mass of statistics.</p>

<p>The stations from which co-operation was asked are the
following, commencing with the most northerly&mdash;Cape Wrath.
Those from which returns have been received are marked with
a *; those which sent returns both last year and this have
two **; those which sent none last year but have done so this
year have a &#8224; prefixed; those which sent returns last year but
none this year are printed in <i>italics</i>. Stations added this
year have the date, 1880, preceding them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Skerryvore, one Brown Owl appeared on 10th
May, at 2.30 p.m., in showery weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Douglas Head,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> one "Black Hawk"
(Sparrowhawk?) was noted at 8 a.m., in clear weather, with
light E.N.E. breeze.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> It is noted on the schedule from this station that the lighthouse,
"being inland, little or any observations on the migration of birds can be
noted accurately."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The earliest date on which Swallows are
recorded from any west coast stations is April 7th, and this at
one of our most northerly stations, <i>viz.</i>, Butt of Lewis. This is
followed by April 17th at Douglas Head, one of our most
southern stations in the Isle of Man; seen at 12 noon; wind
light S.E. breeze, clear or showers; these were not again
observed. Again, on April 24th, their arrival is recorded at
Rhinns of Islay. Thereafter none are noted until 6th May, at
Loch Ryan, in Wigtownshire, when a flight of fifty was observed,
followed by twenty and fifteen on the 8th and 11th: winds from
N.W. through N. to E. and fresh, clear to haze. At Skerryvore,
one was seen on 10th May, in calm, hazy and rainy weather.
On 11th, 12th and 13th, eight flew about the Point of Ayre. On
24th, four were seen <i>flying south</i> past Ardnamurchan station.
On 22nd, one at Monach Island; winds from S.W. to N.W.,
fresh. The remaining records are in June. On June 14th, at
Ardnamurchan, two again seen flying southwards; and on 22nd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span>
at Skerryvore; calm, hazy weather. Possibly these June records
of birds flying south may belong to the autumn migration.
It thus appears that a spring <i>rush</i> took place in the earlier part
of May&mdash;from the 6th to the 14th. About the same time,
<i>viz.</i>, May 20th, a flock of "Martin Swallows," <i>Hirundo urbica</i>,
appeared at the Butt of Lewis during light W. wind, with haze;
they stopped about three hours and then flew off, going S.W.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Swallows and Martins were first observed at Ballina,
Co. Wicklow, Ireland, by Mr. E. Warren, on April 19th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span>, <i>Cypselus</i>.&mdash;First noted at Ballina by Mr. Warren, on
May 12th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i>.&mdash;Records from three stations
only in spring, <i>viz.</i>, Skervuile, Monach, and Butt of Lewis.
Earliest date at Skervuile (most southern of the three). May 1st,
where one was seen at lantern at midnight; wind light S.
Next date is May 4th, at Monach, when about twenty, mixed
with Larks and Wagtails, were seen and two killed between 8.30
p.m. and 3 a.m.; wind light from N. to W. The latest and only
other record dates May 20th, at Butt of Lewis, where five were
seen; wind light W., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagtail</span>, <i>Motacilla Yarrellii</i>.&mdash;Two stations, <i>viz.</i>, at Kyleakin
and Butt of Lewis. At Kyleakin, April 1st, twenty-six rested at
4 p.m., wind E.S.E., haze; 2nd, twenty-four rested at 8 a.m.,
wind S.E., haze. At Butt of Lewis, April 13th, a flock at 7 a.m.,
stopped a few days and left flying south, light E. wind, clear;
and a few days later, "one lighter than the rest" left, going
south. At Kyleakin, April 17th, twelve were seen flying S.E. at
7 a.m., light breeze, with fog; and on 18th, at 1 p.m., twelve
more rested and then flew off south, wind light S.W., and
fog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;I have but few records of the
spring migration, <i>viz.</i>, from Lochindaul, Fladda, and Dhuheartach.
The earliest at Fladda, April 4th, when twenty-four were seen at
10 a.m., breeze fresh, with showers, and clear. At Dhuheartach,
April 13th, between midnight and 8 a.m., three birds rested;
night foggy, and wind light N. At Lochindaul, May 18th, some
were seen, wind moderate, and weather foggy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skylark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;At Dhuheartach and Monach,
April 13th, ten at night, wind light N., cloudy, seven killed; and
May 1st, one at midnight, wind S., haze; and at these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">-72-</span>
stations, on May 4th, flock, mixed with Wheatears and
Wagtails, from 8.30 p.m. till 3 a.m., wind light W. to N., haze
and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span>, <i>Cuculus canorus</i>.&mdash;The following are the stations
where it was noted as first seen or heard, commencing in the
south:&mdash;At Point of Ayre, May 1st, light airs and haze. At
Lochindaul, May 16th, E., clear; the reporter adds, "but is
earlier in Islay." At Rhinns of Islay, April 21st, wind light W.
At Skervuile, May 10th, first seen, wind N., clear. At Stornoway,
May 4th. At Kyleakin, May 5th. At Rhu Stoir, June 15th,
wind light N., haze.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;First noted at Ballina, Ireland, by Mr. Warren, on
May 12th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oystercatcher</span>, <i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>.&mdash;At Lochindaul,
Dhuheartach, and Island Ghlais. At Dhuheartach, April 14th
and 17th, 8 and 10 a.m., ten and seventeen resting or feeding,
wind light N.W., haze or fog. At Lochindaul, May 20th and 21st,
10 a.m., resting, light wind, fog. At Island Ghlais, June 30th,
6 p.m., two feeding, calm, and heavy showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, <i>Numenius arquata</i>.&mdash;So far as a spring migration can
be separated by the data at command, the whole season has
apparently being occupied by Curlews in moving about, the
results are as follows:&mdash;Beginning on 16th, south, we find
spring records at Lochindaul, Rhuvaal, Dhuheartach, Monach,
and Skerryvore. The first note dates March 1st, at Rhuvaal;
eight seen, S.W. gale and rain. The second at Dhuheartach,
April 13th, 4 p.m., when three were seen, wind light, cloudy.
Thereafter at Lochindaul, May 14th. At Skerryvore, May 23rd.
At Monach, June 13th. At Lochindaul, June 14th. At Skerryvore,
June 23rd. Winds variable E., N.W. to S.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whimbrel.</span>&mdash;"May fowl" arrived on Monach, on their way
north, upon May 8th, when three were seen flying about, wind
light N., clear. On May 25th, several parties of from three or
four to six seen flying between Monach and Haskeir rocks, wind
fresh S.W., clear. The note is added, "Arrive in May, leave in
July."</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. R. Warren notes their first appearance at Ballina
on May 1st.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach, April 13th, three Snipe killed,
strong N. breeze, cloudy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">-73-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn Crake</span>, <i>Crex pratensis</i>.&mdash;The Corn Crake was heard at
Kyleakin on June 11th, and at Stornoway on May 4th, clear and
fine; and at Lochindaul on May 18th, at night.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;At Ballina it was first noted by Mr. Warren on
May 2nd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Goose.</span>&mdash;At Rhu Stoir, May 12th, 10 a.m., twelve Wild
Geese seen, three males and three females; light N. airs, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks</span>, <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>.&mdash;At Rhuvaal, Island Ghlais, and Rhu Stoir.
At Rhuvaal, March 8th, great numbers daily seen, where, however,
they became scarcer between April 20th and 30th. At Rhu
Stoir, June 18th, 10 a.m., six Eiders, three males and three
females, wind light N., clear; and July 28th, 8.30 a.m., thirty
"Wild Ducks," wind N.E., haze and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terns.</span>&mdash;Two evidently paired birds seen at Rhu Stoir on
May 18th, light to fresh variable winds. On May 26th, about
2 p.m., some scores of Terns were seen at Monach during S.W.
gale, and were the first that arrived to breed there; and on June
14th, lots of nests containing two to three eggs were seen. At
Skervuile, May 10th, Terns were first observed this spring, wind
light E., and haze; and by 31st great numbers had passed;
some were again seen on June 18th, in similar weather. At
Rhinns of Islay, May 12th, three seen at noon, fresh E. breeze;
and all during June, large numbers of "Tick Terns" fishing in
Lochindaul. At Stornoway, June 5th, they kept arriving at all
hours, and were the first to come to the breeding grounds.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. T. Garriock notes the spring arrival of Terns at
Lerwick, in Shetland, <i>from the north</i>, on May 22nd, in 'The
Zoologist' (<i>q. v.</i>, 1880, p. 302); and, in a letter to me, he
substantiates his observation. Mr. Robert Warren notes the
first appearance of Sandwich Terns at Ballina, Ireland, on March
24th, and of Common Terns on May 14th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Two Sparrowhawks appeared at Rhu Stoir, in
attendance upon flocks of Finches and Larks, on Oct. 20th,
during light variable breezes, with snow. Also at Skerryvore, a
Hawk&mdash;probably of the same species, or a Merlin&mdash;lived on the
small birds on Oct. 14th and 15th; whilst at Dhuheartach a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>

the rock. (See our first Report for 1879, 'Zool.,' May, 1880,

in 1880. He observed a large flock of Swifts on Aug. 4th,
proceeding in a southerly direction. The most of the local birds,
however, still remained on the 11th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallows</span>, <i>Hirundinid&aelig;</i>.&mdash;Swallows were no longer seen after
July 16th, at the Point of Ayre, Isle of Man, on which day twenty
young were noticed, until again on Aug. 15th, when eight were
seen flying about. At Turnberry, from thirty to forty were seen
during the daytime on Aug. 26th, in light E. airs; and again
fifty to sixty on Aug. 31st, and forty to fifty on Sept. 2nd.
Numbers were also seen at Mull of Galloway and at Loch Ryan.
Swallows collected on Oct. 4th and flew away S.W., whilst at
Portpatrick great numbers were seen resting and then flying off
S. on Oct. 15th. This S.W. corner of Scotland appears to be a
point of departure of the species, and of several others; and I
would invite special attention at stations all along the Wigton
coast-line.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> All the above observations on the autumn movements
of Swallows were made during the daytime, and in light
E. to N.E. winds. A rush appears to have taken place end of
August and beginning of September, and a later one as late as
the middle of October.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In 1879 the most northerly station was Ardnamurchan,
and the appearance of Swallows much more general. The
earliest record in 1879 of autumn migration was on July 29th,
and the latest Sept. 25th, as against this year, July 16th and
Oct. 15th. Careful attention to the collecting of migrants at
these Wigton headlands would surely result in some interesting
data. Mr. Robert Service writes me that all the headlands, also
along the Stewartry coast-line, are gathering-places for the
land-birds before proceeding southward. At daybreak, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">-75-</span>
September or October, Mr. Service has often watched departing
flights of birds going off southward or seaward, over the Solway
Firth. Large congregations of Swallows were observed by me at
Kinross on telegraph wires on Aug. 3rd, and I was told that they
congregate in the same place every autumn before leaving.
There must have been many hundreds.</p>

<p>The following really belongs to the East Coast Report, and
comes in under Mr. Hardy's notes from Berwickshire and the
Borders:&mdash;Mr. Hardy has abundant evidence of the departure of
Swallows in the border counties. He writes to me as follows:&mdash;"Old
Cambus, Oct. 28th.&mdash;On Sept. 25th and 26th Swallows were
here, and a pair of Martins were then on the coast, seven having
been seen on the 26th. The main party assembled on the coast
on the 21st and 22nd, and were not again visible, excepting this
small party. I went down to the cave where the nests were, and
evidently they were feeding young birds there. On the 30th
they had not left a steading about a mile above Gilsland. They
were present on Oct. 2nd and 3rd near Rosely Castle, eight miles
south of Carlisle. On the 4th they were assembling on the roof
of the Mansion House of Marchmont, Berwickshire, in great
numbers, during snow and sleet. The 'Kelso Chronicle' of Oct.
15th says, 'Swallows were absent three weeks from Kelso, but
again, in Kelso and the country round, their presence that week
had been conspicuous. They had assembled in flocks.' The
same paper of Oct. 22nd states that, 'On Oct. 17th a good many
Swallows were flying about Jedburgh.' At Brampton, Cumberland,
they were seen on Oct. 16th, 'circling round the church for
several days previous.' On Sept. 22nd, Swallows still at Horsley,
in the valley of the Eye, and a Martin still had young in a nest
in the corner of a window."</p>

<p>Besides the above, it is worth while to take notice of an
account of migration that appeared in an early volume of the
'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' relating to the South-west
district of Scotland:&mdash;"An extract of a letter from Capt. Fayrer,
C.M.Z.S., was read. It was dated on board H. M.'s Packet
'Arrow,' Port Patrick, Oct. 23rd, 1831, and referred to the
migration of certain birds from that neighbourhood. That of the
Larks commenced about Oct. 12th. 'Their numbers,' says Capt.
Fayrer, 'are beyond anything I would venture to state, but
millions They start at daylight, steer directly across to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">-76-</span>
the Capelona Islands, off Belfast Loch, and seem to prefer the
wind directly against them. Very large flocks of Starlings have
arrived within the last few days; they start before sunrise, but
steer to the southward. The Lapwings have also arrived, but
these birds do not take their flight till day has set well in; they
appear to go directly across. I see all these birds at each end of
their passage (twenty-one miles), and few, I think, perish."
(P.Z.S., 1831, p. 145.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren.</span>&mdash;Returns from Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Skervuile,
and Turnberry. The earliest date available was at Dhuheartach,
Aug. 18th, when one was seen flying S. at noon, during light
S.W. wind and haze. None are again reported until Oct. 1st,
when "Wrens" were seen mixed with Larks and Thrushes;
winds variable, light, and haze. Then at Skerryvore, Oct. 9th,
one flying about at 11 a.m., light N.E. breeze, clear; and at
Turnberry, Oct. 12th, one struck the lantern at midnight, wind
light N.E. airs. In the autumn migration of 1879 (<i>q. v.</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>)
records came from Monach Island and Dhuheartach. Earliest
Aug. 17th, latest Dec. 9th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldcrest.</span>&mdash;At Turnberry, Sept. 24th, 3 a.m., one struck,
but was not killed, wind light S., and haze; and at Corsewall,
Sept. 27th till 30th, there appears to have been a migration. On
27th, two were seen to strike the lantern at 2 a.m., in fresh south
breeze and haze; on 28th, two also struck in clear weather,
light S. breeze; and on 30th, eight remained around the lights
from 8 p.m. till daylight, wind light S.E., and haze. From the
Mull of Galloway, the negative note is given, "None seen this
year." In 1879, numbers were reported (see Report, 1879) at
Mull of Galloway on July 18th&mdash;only date.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. E. Warren, <i>in lit.</i>, notes the unusual scarcity of
Golden-crested Wrens at Ballina at the end of July, 1880.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>Erithaca rubecula</i>.&mdash;The most northern station where it
is noted is Cape Wrath, where one bird arrived upon Oct. 20th, and
remained until Jan. 11th (when the schedule was returned), or
later. It came at 11.30 a.m., with an E. wind and snow. My
correspondent adds, "It is much thought of." I have ten records
from eight stations, <i>viz.</i>, Cape Wrath, Stornoway, Kyleakin (2),
Isle Ornsay, Dhuheartach, Rhuvaal, Lismore, and Turnberry.
These date from Aug. 18th (Dhuheartach) and Sept. 4th
(Kyleakin) to Dec. 31st (Stornoway), where one was observed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span>
several days previous to that date. Other dates are, Sept. 8th,
(Isle Ornsay), 24th (Turnberry), Oct. 20th (Cape Wrath, as
above), Nov. 7th (Kyleakin and Lismore), Dec. 15th (Lismore),
Dec. 27th (Rhuvaal). All the observations were made during
the daytime, except at Lismore and Turnberry. In August the
wind at Dhuheartach was light S.W. on 18th, with haze; the
one Robin seen flew off S. after resting. At Kyleakin, Sept. 4th,
four birds seen were flying S.W., wind light W., clear. At
Turnberry, Sept. 24th, one struck at 3 a.m., in light S. breeze,
and haze. At Isle Ornsay, one seen. At Cape Wrath, in
October. At Kyleakin, Nov. 7th, three, wind S.E., clear; and
numbers seen at Lismore mingling with Starlings and Larks all
night, wind strong S.W., haze and rain. At Rhuvaal, Dec. 27th,
after stormy weather, two flew about and stayed for a few days;
and at Stornoway, Dec. 31st and a few days previously, one was
seen. On 15th, numbers were round the lights at Lismore, along
with Thrushes, Blackbirds, Grey and Green Linnets, in large
flocks, wind strong N.E., and snow. In 1879, Robins were not
reported from stations further north than Kyleakin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &aelig;nanthe</i>.&mdash;I have eight or nine records
from three stations on the west coast in autumn, <i>viz.</i>, Butt of
Lewis and Dhuheartach. The earliest date is Aug. 13th, when
one was seen at Dhuheartach between 7 and 8 p.m., arriving
with light N. wind, and remaining; and about one hundred,
mostly young birds, left the neighbourhood of the Butt of Lewis,
where&mdash;about a mile from the lighthouse&mdash;they had been collecting
for some days before. Up to Aug. 17th and 18th, a few&mdash;seven
on 17th and six on 18th&mdash;were seen at Dhuheartach about 8 a.m.,
wind light and haze, where they rested and flew off south. On
Aug. 19th, one was killed on the lantern of Douglas Head lighthouse
at 11 p.m., wind E.N.E., and haze. At Dhuheartach,
Sept. 10th, thirty rested, light S. wind, and haze; and between
Sept. 16th and Oct. 1st, large numbers were seen at the lantern
of the Butt of Lewis lighthouse, and many were caught and
released. Skerryvore was the most northerly station in 1879.
Aug. 15th was the earliest record in 1879, and the latest on
Sept. 28th.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Late occurrences of the Wheatear are noted by Mr.
Hardy in Berwickshire. On Sept. 17th they were seen at the
shore and not again afterwards, but a few were present at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span>
Berwick, behind the pier, on Oct. 12th. This is the latest date I
have on the east coast of Scotland. I place the note here&mdash;under
the west coast report&mdash;for special comparison with the following:&mdash;Wheatear.&mdash;An
unusually late stay of this species is recorded by
Mr. Service in Wigtonshire (<i>vide</i> 'Zoologist,' Feb. 1881, pp. 54,
55). Since the note appeared in 'The Zoologist,' I have had
some more correspondence regarding these late Wheatears&mdash;7th
December. Mr. Bruce is strongly of my opinion, that these birds
<i>were really migrating</i> when they flew away northwards, as they
were seen still carrying on when fully a mile away. Before this
they had remained for two or three days with Bullfinches. About
six weeks afterwards "these same Bullfinches" took a similar
route and disappeared; they were seen departing. I am inclined
to agree with my friend and fellow-worker, Mr. Cordeaux, that
these Wheatears probably belonged to the larger race, which
have more arboreal habits than our own. If this is so, the
observation made by Mr. Bruce still further bears out the
probability of their foreign origin. As regards the more arboreal
habits of the larger race, I have explained elsewhere ('Ibis,' 1876,
p. 310) that arboreal habits of such species as Gulls, Curlews,
Snipe, Snow Buntings, &amp;c., in North-east Russia, are probably
brought about by the flooded conditions of the country there, at
the time of the arrival in spring of these migrants. The habit
no doubt grows and even becomes hereditary, and is carried into
other countries and other climes in autumn. Larger races
usually indicate more northern extension, and, in my opinion,
abnormal arboreal habits of certain species indicate that they are
natives of a land subject to constantly recurring floods. For
these reasons I am still inclined to adhere to my opinion that
these Wigtonshire Wheatears, at the late date of Dec. 9th, 1880,
were resting during their regular migration, and departed again
upon an extension of that same migration. They were, in my
belief, strangers, and not bred in the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedgesparrow.</span>&mdash;See under Linnet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagtail.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach, a rush of Wagtails was observed
upon Aug. 17th, 18th, 24th, and 26th, wind light and from S.W.
on 17th and 18th, when twelve were seen each day flying in a
south-easterly direction&mdash;to E.S.E. and S.E. on 24th&mdash;when two
or three rested upon the rock. We had no records of this in
1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thrushes, Blackbirds, and Ring Ouzels.</span>&mdash;Numerous returns
from eleven stations, <i>viz.</i>, Rhu Stoir, Butt of Lewis, Stornoway,
Monach, Kyleakin, Rhuvaal, Lochindaul, Corsewall, Point of
Ayre, Douglas Head, and Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> Earliest date July 19th,
at Point of Ayre, when about 160 young Thrushes (<i>Turdus
musicus</i>) were seen to go off at 9 a.m., flying S. Latest dates
Jan. 8th, 9th and 10th, 1881, when large flocks of Blackbirds,
Thrushes and Snow Buntings flew about all day; and all left on
the 10th when the haze and fog cleared away; fresh E. breeze
during this time. Between these dates, a migration appears to
have taken place on Sept. 21st to 30th, shown, however, by
records from only one station, <i>viz.</i>, Stornoway. There, a good
many Blackbirds and Thrushes arrived on Sept. 21st and left on
30th. These were accompanied also by Stormcocks (<i>Turdus
pilaris</i>, or Fieldfare); weather and wind not noted; but see notes
from Mid-Atlantic, <i>infra</i>. On 29th also, a number of Thrushes
seen hovering round the lights at Douglas Head, along with
Starlings and Blackbirds, in fog and haze. A desultory migration
appears to have been carried on throughout October; I have the
following records:&mdash;At Rhu Stoir, Oct. 1st, forty, besides Linnets,
stayed four days (this comes also under the rush at end of
September), wind variable, light breezes. At Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct.
8th, three were killed at 10.20 p.m., wind light E.N.E. breeze,
and cloudy. At Butt of Lewis, in the north, Oct. 15th, a good
many arrived and stayed till Jan. 15th, 1881, or later. At
Kyleakin, Oct. 20th, two were seen flying south, with strong S.E.
wind; and a few at Lochindaul. At Corsewall, one seen on 7th
and one on 8th, one killed; strong N.E. wind and haze. In
November, the earliest dates occur at the most southern stations;
thus at Point of Ayre, Nov. 2nd and 3rd, about three hundred
Blackbirds and Thrushes, mixed with Starlings, kept about the
locality till 4 a.m. on the 3rd; wind S. to S.E., very foggy.
The direction of flight on departure was not noted, but they were
seen to pass off about 7.30 a.m. Also at the Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on
the 3rd, five were killed and others fell overboard. At Corsewall,
on the same dates, one and two were seen, wind fresh E., and
haze. At Kyleakin, Nov. 4th, seven Blackbirds seen flying south
at 9 a.m., wind S.E., and sleet; again on 11th, two seen flying
S., wind E., haze. At Monach, Nov. 16th, one in the garden,
wind S. to N.N.E., strong, with sleet and snow. In December,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">-80-</span>
at Monach, a few Blackbirds were seen. Thus on Dec. 3rd, one
male seen resting on the lantern at 10 p.m., wind strong W.,
haze. Another female on Dec. 4th, 2 p.m., flying about the
garden, wind fresh S.S.W., haze and rain; and two Blackbirds,
accompanied by Starlings, at 1 p.m., wind fresh S., clear in the
garden and on the shore. As already noted, a still later flight
was noted in January, 1881, at Point of Ayre, Isle of Man.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Thrushes, amongst other birds (<i>vide</i> Robins, Linnets,
Snipe, Wagtails, &amp;c.), were recognised by Capt. Roy in Mid-Atlantic,
400 miles on this side of Newfoundland. To Mr. Robt.
Gray I am indebted for some interesting and useful notes
regarding the occurrences of birds in Mid-Atlantic:&mdash;"The ship
'Rutland,' of Greenock, Capt. Roy. When about 400 miles on
this side of Newfoundland, during continued heavy gales from
the east, Capt. Roy observed numbers of birds taking refuge on
the 20th September. He had had head-winds all the way home
to England, and birds more or less numerous round the ship till
the 25th October. When he was 400-500 miles from Ireland, a
violent storm arose and blew prodigious flocks of birds before it.
The deck and rigging were covered. Many died, and many were
killed and used as food. The survivors, after staying a few days,
were carried off by the force of the wind. Capt. Roy observed
one Robin, lots of Linnets, Snipe, Thrushes, Wagtails, &amp;c.
Heavy rains accompanied the storm." Mr. Gray continues,
"My brother-in-law, on his way to Boston in one of the Cunard
steamers, saw a Jackdaw and a Starling come on board on Oct.
23rd, during a gale from the east, when 550 miles from the Irish
coast, easterly winds having prevailed for several days. On Oct.
24th, 850 miles from land, one Starling perched for a few
minutes. A small bird like a Linnet hovered about the rigging,
but did not perch. One Water Rail was captured and detained
ten days, 1200 miles from land, and two Sandpipers. Writing
again on Dec. 21st, he tells me that on the outward passage, lat.
42&deg; N., long. 54&deg; W., he had in view at one time from five to six
hundred Gulls, various species&mdash;an extraordinary number to be
so far from land. When about 1080 miles from Ireland, going
out, two <i>Crossbills</i> flew on board. Both were captured."</p>

<p>Thomas Anderson (son of Thomas Anderson, joint author
with Mr. Robert Gray of 'The Birds of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire')
and Mr. Gray inform me, a good observer, and who has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">-81-</span>
for many years kept a bird-log, at Mr. Robert Gray's request.
Being chief-engineer on board a Cunard liner, he has crossed the
Atlantic some four hundred times, during most or all of which
time he has kept careful notes. It is hoped that he or Mr. Gray
will give us the benefit of these notes before long, as they cannot
fail to be of great interest and use to students of migration.</p>

<p>Mr. T. E. Bruce, of Slogarrie, observed some Missel Thrushes
flying south on March 4th, 1881, and on the same day Snow
Buntings. Great storm of snow on March 4th and 5th, from
N.E.; this no doubt a local and temporary migration caused by
the severe weather. The Missel Thrushes having previously
arrived on spring migration, compelled to return again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The returns are from Monach, Sound of Mull,
Rhinns of Islay, Portpatrick, and Bahama (<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>) Earliest at
Portpatrick, Aug. 16th, flocks flying round between 11 a.m. and
4 p.m., wind light E., and clear (probably only a local movement).
Latest at Monach, Dec. 29th, when about a dozen were seen at
noon flying south over the island. At Sound of Mull, in October,
about two hundred "Daws" are reported flying N.E. on the 9th,
wind light E. and clear; and at Rhinns of Islay, on the 10th,
flocks of Black Crows (Rooks ?) seen flying W., wind light, clear.
At Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on 24th, one flying E. at 7.25 a.m., wind N.W.,
and showery. But in November there appears to have been a
rush; also on Nov. 5th, ten "Crows" seen at Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> flying
W.N.W. at 8 a.m., wind moderate N.W. by N. (the strength
registered is 4); and at the same station, on the 25th, about two
hundred and fifty "Crows" were seen flying from E. to W., with
a W.S.W. wind, strength 6, and weather gloomy. In my return
from Monach I find that six "small black Crows," which may
have been either Books or Jackdaws, were seen passing over the
island, flying north-west or north, in the direction of the Lews,
driven along by a strong S.S.E. gale upon Nov. 20th.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In 52&deg; 50&#8242; north lat. and 22&deg; 21&#8242; west long., being 475
miles off the Irish coast, after six weeks' easterly gale and winds,
wind E.S.E. for ten hours previous, two Books flew to the barque
'East.' One fell exhausted on deck, and the other into the sea.
The former was shown to me by the Captain&mdash;Capt. Younoun&mdash;on
board the 'East' at Granton. The above, as related to me,
was upon Nov. 19th; and it may be interesting in connection
with this to read the notes supplied by Mr. R. Gray, as given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">-82-</span>
under Thrush. Of a later observation at Monach, on Dec. 29th,
I have already spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;I have received many returns of
this species, as is usually the case in autumn. Commencing at
our most northerly stations, I have returns from Cape Wrath,
Rhu Stoir, Stornoway, Island Ghlais (or Glas), Monach, Kyleakin,
Fladda, Rhinns of Islay, Lochindaul, Corsewall, Point of Ayre,
Douglas Head, and Bahama (<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>) The earliest dates are
August; arrive and remain all the season afterwards at Lochindaul;
but at Rhinns of Islay, adjoining, arrive in September and
remain; resident thereafter. At Corsewall, Aug. 4th, a flock
flying south, fresh S. wind. At Kyleakin, Sept. 12th, three,
moderate S. wind, and haze. At Cape Wrath, Sept. 14th, twenty
young, flying from E. to W. (see remarks on occurrences in Mid-Atlantic,
under Thrushes, antea, p. 80); on 17th, a large flock at
10 p.m., wind strong S., with haze and rain; stayed a few days
and then left. At Corsewall, Sept. 28th, a flock flying S., strong
breeze, clear. Sept. 29th and 30th, a number seen hovering
round the lights of Douglas Head Lighthouse at midnight, with
Thrushes and Blackbirds, and none seen after daylight came in.
At Kyleakin, Nov. 3rd and 5th, forty adult and young rested,
wind light N. to light S., clear, and sleet. Also on Nov. 2nd and
3rd, whilst numbers were striking all night till dawn at Corsewall,
a large number were flying round Point of Ayre lights, mixed
with Thrushes and Blackbirds, and thirty-six were killed; and on
same date, one was killed at lantern of Douglas Head: and six
killed and fell overboard at Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, out of a large flock of
mixed Thrushes and Starlings. At Monach, Nov. 6th, one adult
rested, wind light N.W., drizzle. At Monach, Nov. 17th, twenty-four
young, N.N.E. gale, sleet and snow; left on 18th. At
Stornoway, Dec. 19th and 20th, large flocks, wind E., sleet and
rain. At Monach, Dec. 27th, a flock of young birds, along with
a large flock of Larks, flying about the garden and shores at
1 p.m., wind S., fresh and clear; and again on Jan. 14th, 1881,
a great many flocks, mixed old and young, at 10 a.m., flying to
and fro between the island and North Uist, apparently being
local movements caused by heavy snow in Uist. In 1879, the
most northerly record comes from Ardnamurchan, whereas this
year, as is usually the case, they are much more general. The
earliest date in 1879 was Aug. 14th, at Loch Ryan and M'Arthur's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">-83-</span>
Head, whilst this year it was the 4th, at Corsewall. The latest
in 1879 was Dec. 18th, at Skervuile. This year, in December,
at Stornoway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finches</span>, <i>Fringillid&aelig;</i>.&mdash;At Rhu Stoir, Sept. 17th, large flocks
at 10 p.m., strong S. wind, haze and rain; stayed a few days
with Starlings and then left. Crossbills (<i>vide</i> Mr. Anderson's
notes on Mid-Atlantic, antea, p. 80). Mr. Robt. Gray afterwards
informed me that the two Crossbills captured are of the American
species (<i>Loxia leucoptera</i>), judging from Mr. Anderson's description.
The same species was captured by the late Dr. Dewar on board
ship (Royal Phyl. Soc, and 'Birds of West of Scotland');
and at same locality Finches were seen on Oct. 20th, light
variable winds, and snow. Only returns in 1879 were from
Dhuheartach on Aug. 24th, and Oct. 4th and 8th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree Sparrow</span>.&mdash;On Lismore, Nov. 15th, a small flock
observed, strong N. wind, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch.</span>&mdash;Only one record on west coast is given, <i>viz.</i>, at
Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 11th, when one is recorded flying N.W. at
8 a.m., wind E.N.E., and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnets.</span>&mdash;Returns from Skerryvore, Lismore, and Point of
Ayre. Earliest date Sept. 12th, when a rush appears to have
taken place past Point of Ayre between that date and Sept. 29th;
principally, however, on Sept. 12th and 20th, when young birds
to the number of fifty or sixty&mdash;on the 20th mixed with Hedgesparrows&mdash;were
seen flying W. on both days about 8 a.m., wind
light W., clear. They appeared plentiful also on the 28th, but a
few only seen on 29th. Again in same locality there appeared to
be a rush on Oct. 18th and 24th, when twenty and one hundred
Greenfinches were seen, in light and fresh W. wind; and at
Skerryvore, Oct. 14th, twelve "Grey Linnets" flew about the
rock, wind light E., with haze. On Nov. 13th, a small flock
frequented Lismore during the day, wind strong S.W. to W., and
rain; and at the same station, Dec. 15th, both Grey and Green
Linnets, mixed with Robins, Larks, Thrushes, and Blackbirds,
flew about; wind strong N.E., and snow. In 1879, Sept. 9th is
the only date given at Rhuvaal and Lamlash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting</span>, <i>Emberiza nivalis</i>.&mdash;Records have been kept at
Rhu Stoir in the north, and southward at Monach, Dhuheartach,
Corsewall, and Point of Ayre. The earliest occurrence was at
Dhuheartach on Sept. 19th, when one bird was seen; wind fresh W.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span>
From Oct. 1st to 8th, at Rhu Stoir, about forty arrived and
stayed till the latter date; wind on day of arrival N.W. gale with
sleet. On Oct. 1st, at Monach also, they were first seen, one at
10 a.m.; wind fresh S.S.W. and cloudy. At Point of Ayre from
fifty to sixty were seen at 7.30 a.m., mixed with Thrushes and
Blackbirds, fresh S.E. wind, clear, on Nov. 2nd and 3rd. On
Nov. 6th, at Monach, one at 10 p.m., N.W. wind and drizzle of
rain. On Nov. 16th a few seen at 2 p.m. during a S. to N.N.E.
gale, and the latest record is at Corsewall, on Jan. 5th, 1881,
when one was seen and struck the lantern at 3.30 a.m., light N.E.
wind, haze. In 1879 most northerly station, Monach Island.
Earliest date same as this year (1879, Monach; 1880, Dhuheartach).
Latest date in 1879, Dec. 10th (Corsewall), against
Jan. 5th, 1881 (Corsewall), in 1880.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The unusually large and sudden immigration of Snow
Buntings into Great Britain attracted general attention. From
the middle of November onward they were extremely abundant,
and they ushered in the severe winter and low temperatures of
January, 1881.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sky Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;A good many returns from the
following stations:&mdash;Rhu Stoir, Kyleakin, Dhuheartach, Skervuile,
Rhinns of Islay, Turnberry, Corsewall, and Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> The
earliest, Sept. 30th, at Corsewall, at 9 p.m., when two were seen,
which remained till dawn on the lantern along with Golden-crested
Wrens. The latest at Turnberry on Jan. 4th, 1881, when
one struck at 8 p.m., light N.E. wind with haze. In October, on
the 1st, at Skervuile, some were seen mixed with Thrushes and
Wrens; winds variable and light, with haze. On the 3rd, at
Turnberry, two struck, and one killed between 10 and 11 p.m.,
wind light E. and clear. On 12th, at Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> a flock seen
flying W. at 9.20 a.m., wind light N.E., with haze. On 13th
twenty seen at Dhuheartach at 1 a.m., wind light N., cloudy. On
Dec. 27th a large flock was seen flying about the garden and
shores at Monach along with young Starlings and two Blackbirds,
at 1 p.m., wind S., fresh breeze, clear. In 1879 the most northerly
station was Dhuheartach. Earliest date in 1879, Sept. 19th;
latest Dec. 6th; but it must be remembered in this and all such
comparisons that in 1879 our returns' were sent in sooner than
in 1880.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Local migrations of large extent, brought on by heavy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">-85-</span>
falls of snow and consequent scarcity of food, have been frequently
noted this season. When crossing the Firth of Forth on the
15th December I saw many large flocks of Larks, both in the
morning and afternoon, flying steadily from N.N.W. to S.S.E. or
N.W. to S.E. Many Larks were afterwards seen feeding near
Leith, and notice of the fact sent to the papers by another witness.
The line of flight, as I have said, was from N. of West to S. of
East. I note the fact as having significance, even in a local
migration, at this locality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Pigeon.</span>&mdash;July 10th, sixteen Rock Pigeons at Island
Ghlais, flying S., 8 p.m., light N., haze and showers, refers
probably to a local migration. At Skerryvore two "wild
pigeons" (Rock Doves?) seen during calm hazy weather on
June 24th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapwing</span>, <i>Vanellus cristatus</i>.&mdash;At Rhuvaal, Lochindaul, and
Portpatrick. Aug. 4th, at Lochindaul, large flocks seen all through
the month after this date: resident. Sept. 1st, two killed at
Rhuvaal, 11 p.m., strong S., haze. Sept. 9th, flocks flying S. at
9 a.m. at Portpatrick; wind S.E., hazy. Sept. 15th, Lochindaul,
flocks all day; strong N. wind, clear. One at Monach on Dec.
27th, wind S., flying S. More northerly in 1879, <i>viz.</i>, Rhu Stoir
and southwards. Earliest date Aug. 20th; latest Dec. 11th.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In Ireland Lapwings began to assemble on the shores
by July 22nd, as observed by Mr. Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Plover</span>, <i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>.&mdash;Only two records this
year from Island Ghlais and Point of Ayre: Dec. 3rd, twenty to
thirty at 9 a.m. flying S.W., light airs, showers, at the former;
Jan. 12th, 1881, at the latter, a flock flying E., wind strong E.,
clear. Two or three flocks were seen upon Monach on Dec. 27th,
at 1 p.m., flying along to shore, wind S., fresh breeze. A considerable
movement appears to have been observed at Monach on
this date. In 1879 three stations, most northerly being Skerryvore.
Earliest date July 27th, at Portpatrick; latest on Oct. 18th,
at Skerryvore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ringed Plover.</span>&mdash;On Aug. 13th twelve "Dotterels" arrived
upon Dhuheartach. These remain on the rock all winter, unless
driven off by severe weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heron.</span>&mdash;Two Herons seen at 2 p.m. at Rhu Stoir, N.W. gale,
snow showers. At Monach four Herons rested on the shore on
Oct. 28th, about 2 o'clock, wind strong N.E., with snow showers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">-86-</span>
they had left by next day. Common and of daily occurrence at
Kyleakin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, <i>Numenius arquatus</i>.&mdash;Of this species we have many
records, and it does not seem easy to distinguish between migration
data and residence. However, I give the leading points for
further comparison. They occurred, or are recorded, at Cape
Wrath, and thence south at Island Ghlais, Monach, Kyleakin,
Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Rhuvaal, Skervuile, Lochindaul, Portpatrick.
Point of Ayre, and Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> They seemed to fly in
all directions, indicating to a great extent only local migration.
From April and May, on through June and July, and all the
autumn months they occur rather distinctly as resident, or as
passing flocks, and it seems almost impossible to separate the
movements in the end of summer which should be assigned as
part of the spring migration from those in the beginning of
autumn which more rightly belong to the autumnal migration.
As will be seen, however, I have attempted to do so, assigning
all June records to the former and July records to the latter.
The earliest record, then, in autumn stands as July 15th, when
forty were seen flying W. at 4.20 p.m. at Island Ghlais, wind
light N., clear. The latest recorded are on Dec. 25th, 26th and
27th at Rhu Stoir, flying south; winds N. or light and variable
with showers. The general courses pursued were southerly or
from N.W. to S.E., or from N.E. to S.W., some flying direct W.,
however, and others direct S.; but at Portpatrick, on Aug. 19th
and 23rd, flocks were seen flying north and also south, indicating
a local migration. On Aug. 19th the wind was light S., haze,
and on 23rd light E., clear. Numbers passed Dhuheartach
between Aug. 12th and 17th, all going in southerly directions,
from S. to S.W. and S.E. On Monach they were unusually
abundant this year all September, and more than a dozen were
shot. "Bushes," so far as such data are of value, appear to
have taken place in August, 12th to 17th, or even later,&mdash;say to
23rd,&mdash;and locally, at Lochindaul, on Aug. 4th and 5th, and in
September, as 10th and 25th, at Dhuheartach, and "unusually
abundant all September on Monach." In November, on the 3rd,
at Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Curlews were flying round the vessel all night.
On Aug. 15th four seen circling round Dhuheartach in calm,
clear weather, and on the 18th two seen flying south in light W.
wind and haze. On Nov. 2nd, at Douglas Head, one was killed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">-87-</span>
on lantern at 10.30 p.m., wing strong S.E. and haze. On
Nov. 6th one "Sandpiper" was killed at lantern at Island Ghlais
in a fresh W. breeze. In 1879 most northerly station was Island
Ghlais; this year much more general. Earliest date in 1879,
Aug. 3rd; latest Nov. 20th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe.</span>&mdash;I have returns only from three stations, Island
Ghlais, Kyleakin and Douglas Head. The earliest at Kyleakin,
Oct. 11th, when two appeared in light E. wind and rain; at the
same station, Nov. 16th, one was killed on lantern at 2 a.m., in
light S. wind and haze. At Douglas Head, Nov. 18th, one killed
at midnight in snow, N.E. breeze. At Island Ghlais, Nov. 27th,
one was killed during a W. gale and haze and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span>, <i>Scolopax rusticola</i>.&mdash;Commencing in the north we
have records of occasional birds at Cape Wrath, Rhu Stoir,
Island Ghlais, Kyleakin, Ardnamurchan, Lismore, and Point of
Ayre. The earliest occurrence is noted at Island Ghlais, Sept.
23rd, seen half a mile from lighthouse. Then we have occurrence
at Point of Ayre, where one was killed at the lantern on nights of
Nov. 2nd and 3rd, at 7 o'clock, light S.E. wind, very foggy. At
Lismore, Nov. 20th, one seen at 11 a.m., light N.W. wind, clear.
The rush appeared most conspicuous from Dec. 10th, when
one was killed at Ardnamurchan, at 5.30 a.m., in strong W.
wind, with thick rain; at Kyleakin, Dec. 11th, when two were
seen at 2.30 p.m., moderate N.E. wind, snow lying on the ground;
and at Rhu Stoir, Dec. 25th, 26th and 27th; on 25th, three, flying
south, light N. wind, snow; 26th, one, variable, and light
showers of snow; 27th, two, light, variable and clear; lastly,
at Rhu Stoir, Jan. 12th, two, light S.E. wind, clear.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Northernmost Station, Island Ghlais, 1879. Earliest
record, Oct. 11th (Rhinns of Islay), 1879; latest record, Dec.
12th, 1879. So long ago as the date of the "Lays of the Deer
Forest," 1848, numbers of Woodcock are recorded as settling
about the lamps of the northern lighthouses, and evidence is
given from Cape Wrath (<i>loc. cit.</i>, 'Notes,' vol. ii., p. 262).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Goose.</span>&mdash;At Portpatrick, Aug. 6th, one was seen flying
S.E., in light E. breeze; at the same station, Jan. 13th, ten
were observed flying S., with a strong N. breeze. At Point of
Ayre, Jan. 11th, about twenty were seen flying S., with light
N.E. breeze. At Monach, Nov. 30th, eight were seen at 8 p.m.,
flying westward, and settled on some rocks off the island, wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">-88-</span>
S.E., fresh, rain; and Jan. 9th, 1881, fifteen at 9 a.m. flying
northwards, wind S., light, clear. At Douglas Head, Dec. 17th,
eight Geese were seen flying from E. to W. at 12 a.m., calm,
clear. At Butt of Lewis, Jan. 6th, six Wild Geese at 9 a.m., light
S.W. wind, clear; came to the village about a mile off, stopped
two days; left, going S. At Island Ghlais, Jan. 4th, fifty Wild
Geese flying S., 1 p.m.; wind N., fresh, clear. At Rhuvaal,
Dec. 12th, six dozen seen, after stormy weather, in light S.W.
breeze.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;On Jan. 29th, 1880, four dozen, old and young,
resident on Islay, were by Feb. 15th, 1880, reduced to about two
dozen. It is recorded in the Wernerian Societies Memoirs, in
a report from the light-keeper at Lismore lighthouse (which
report was not published in full), that most birds of a flock of
Brent Geese were killed against the building, and that one bird
passed through quarter-inch glass "like a shot" (Mem. Wern.
Soc, read Jan. 24th, 1835).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swan</span>, <i>Cygnus</i>.&mdash;At Rhu Stoir, Dec. 25th, 2 p.m., flying S.E.,
light N. wind, snow storm. (At Loch Inver, Jan. 1st, 1881, two
seen at a loch there.) At Butt of Lewis, Jan. 16th, two, stayed
four days at a village four miles off and left on 20th or 21st,
flying S.; wind N.E., sleet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks</span>, <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>.&mdash;At Monach, Skerryvore and Dhuheartach.
At Dhuheartach, Oct. 12th, nineteen Eiders&mdash;sixteen males and
three females, noon, fresh N. wind, clear; engaged in fishing. At
Monach, Oct. 27th, two flocks of Eiders, male and female, 3 p.m.,
wind N., cloudy; "first arrival here from breeding-grounds."
At Dhuheartach, Oct. 28th, forty fishing round, light N.E. wind;
Oct. 29th, the same flock. These remain all the season, usually
arriving about Oct. 12th, but they do not land here; later in
arrival this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Northern Diver.</span>&mdash;At Monach, May 25th, two&mdash;male
and female&mdash;Great Northern Divers seen, wind S.W., fresh,
clear. These birds are seen at intervals all through the year,
three being the largest number Mr. Youngclause has seen at one
time; he has shot three during the last five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red-throated Diver.</span>&mdash;At Monach, May 22nd, twelve were
seen feeding in pairs along the shore; wind N.W., fresh,
showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Birds</span>, <i>Natatores</i>.&mdash;Razorbills, Guillemots, Puffins. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">-89-</span>
speaking of these I believe the simplest way will be to take the
spring and autumn migration together, and I here simply write
down the results as they appear in the schedules. Cape Wrath,
April 20th, about 1000 Razorbills, 2000 Puffins, and 2000
Guillemots arrived to breed; wind S., showers. Aug. 29th, about
2000 Razorbills, 4000 Puffins, and 4000 Guillemots left; wind
S.E., clear. Or in other words, about twice as many left in
autumn as came in spring. "These birds have building cliffs
about three miles east of the Cape. The time of the day they
come is not known, nor the directions in which they come and go.
They come in one night, and go in one night." At Island Ghlais,
July 10th, about ninety Puffins, 4 p.m., flying S., haze, doubtless
a local migration for food; July 11th, about 200 Puffins, 1 p.m.,
wind N., flying S.W., clear; July 22nd, numbers feeding on
herring-soil in shore; Aug. 9th, numbers feeding on herring-soil
in shore. At Ushenish, May 30th, numbers passing; local
migration, strong S. wind. At Kyleakin, May 10th, numbers of
Guillemots passing E. all day; strong E.N.E. wind. At Skervuile,
July 21st to 27th, Marrots seen. Those seen at Island
Ghlais are almost undoubtedly bred at the Shiant Isles (see
former Report, 1879).</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;I have no return this year from Dunnet Head, owing
to the absence of Mr. Geo. Maclachlan, the new keeper not
having sent me one, which I much regret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gulls.</span>&mdash;At Cape Wrath, April 12th, 300 "Sea Gulls" arrived
here for breeding on the cliffs below the lighthouse, between
7 a.m. and 8 a.m., wind E., clear; July 12th, from 300 to 800
Sea Gulls leave and passed to W., between 3 a.m. and 10 p.m.,
wind E., haze and rain; April 20th, 200 Kittiwakes arrived;
Aug. 29th, 600 Kittiwakes left, wind S.E., clear. At Island
Ghlais, July 22nd, 500 to 600 Gulls and Kittiwakes, Puffins, &amp;c.,
feeding, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; wind S., light, clear; probably from
Shiant Isles. (See Mr. Anderson's notes on Gulls in Mid-Atlantic,
under Thrush, <i>antea</i> p. 80). At Sound of Mull, Aug. 13th,
200 Kittiwakes, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., flying N.W. in flocks of twenty
to thirty; light W. wind, clear. At Rhuvaal, March 1st, about
four dozen, 10 a.m., S.W. wind to gale, rain and sleet; May 1st,
about one dozen, 9 a.m., S.W. wind, clear; Oct. 13th, twelve,
flying S., 7 a.m., variable, light, haze; Nov. 1st, Gulls (and
Curlews), 9 a.m., W. wind, clear. At Skervuile, June 8th, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">-90-</span>
Black-headed Gull, 9 am., N.W. wind, light breeze, rain, "not
often seen here;" July 17th, "Boatswain Bird," 10 p.m., first
seen, also Kittiwakes; July 21st to 27th, "Boatswain Gulls"
seen; Aug. 2nd, great numbers of ditto seen. At Corsewall,
Nov. 1st, one Kittiwake seen, 9.45 p.m.; fresh E. breeze. At
Stornoway, July 21st, a flock, apparently migrating, flying N.,
9 p.m., light N.E. wind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terns.</span>&mdash;At Monach, Aug. 15th to 20th, great flocks were
congregating previous to departure; winds light, clear; and by
20th all were gone, except a few detained by late young ones
(see spring migration, under Tern). They are also reported to
have left the neighbourhood of Stornoway lighthouse by Aug.
15th. On Aug. 26th, sixteen "Sea Swallows" arrived at
Bahama light-vessel, at 2.20 p.m., in hazy weather; wind light
S.E. by E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gannet</span>, <i>Sula bassana</i>.&mdash;In the same way I give the data as
shown in the schedules. At Cape Wrath, April 14th, 800 to 900
flying E., for breeding at Souliskerry, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.;
wind E., clear. At Douglas Head, April 18th, one, light N.E.
wind, clear; July 14th to Aug. 28th, 60 to 900 daily, flying W.,
7 a.m. to 9 p.m. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;I am informed by Mr. Gray that Mr.
Anderson traced the Gannet as far south as the latitude of South
Spain, where one day the ship passed through acres of them;
they seemed dead beat, as if after a toilsome flight during a
succession of autumn gales. At Rhu Stoir, July 1st to Aug. 31st,
large flocks going N. daily along the coast, largest numbers
about end of July; generally passing between 7 and 9 p.m.; none
seen going south. At Butt of Lewis, April 13th, three Solan Geese
seen, 9 a.m., the first seen; May 20th to Sept. 15th, increased daily
till May 20th, and then on till middle of September, it would be
impossible to count them from dawn till dusk: they passed in
long strings of fifty to sixty in a flock at not more than a quarter
of hour's interval between the flocks; they all flew west. A
number (about one-fifth of the whole) fly east, and take
no notice of the others in their flight; these are single birds:
not one seen after Oct. 15th. At Island Ghlais, July 12th, 150
Solan Geese "flying S. and N.," 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., light airs, W.,
clear; July 13th, 200 "flying S. and N.," 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., fresh
N. wind; July 15th to 31st, 1600 to 2000 flying both N. and S.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">-91-</span>
variable; daily average about 100. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The expression
"flying S. and N." probably means <i>from S. to N.</i>) At Skervuile,
March 1st, at 8 a.m., S.W. gale, rain and sleet; Oct. 26th, last seen
10 a.m., fresh N.E. wind, clear. At Lochindaul, May 14th, one
seen fishing, wind E., clear, dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cormorants.</span>&mdash;At Cape Wrath, April 16th, thirty "Scarts"
arrived, 10 a.m., E. wind, showers. At Stornoway, Sept. 14th,
seven flying S.W. at noon, light S.W. wind, clear; Sept. 21st,
flock of ditto at 2 p.m., light W. wind, flying S.W., raining;
Oct. 26th, flock of ditto flying W., 11 a.m., N. gale, snow;
Dec. 24th, flock of ditto flying S.E., N. wind, fresh, snow. The
above probably refer to local migrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unidentified.</span>&mdash;At Portpatrick, between Oct. 7th and 28th, a
migration appears to have gone on at intervals of small birds:
thus on the 7th "flocks of small birds," at 7 a.m., strong N.E.
breeze, clear, flying S.W.; the same on the 14th, flying S.W., in
light easterly wind, and clear; the same on the 15th, flying W.,
in light S. winds, clear; the same on the 28th, light N.E. wind,
hazy, direction and flight not noted. Again, flocks of small
birds on Dec. 25th, at the same station, flying E., were observed,
in strong N. breeze; and flocks flew round all day on 26th, in
light E. wind, and clear. In August, on the 25th, at 5.45 p.m.,
fifty-two (species unknown) seen flying S.S.W., at Bahama <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
light E. by S. wind.</p>

<h3 id="General_Remarks_4"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>In our general remarks, in 1879, we took notice of the
scarcity of birds at many important stations, such as the Butt of
Lewis, Monach Island, &amp;c. This season shows a considerable
increase upon last year's returns, and the horizontal lines of
migration&mdash;or rays of the fan&mdash;seem to have spread out wider
and reached farther north in 1880 than in 1879; and this
increase of observations on the west coast, be it noted, is
irrespective, apparently, of the scarcity upon our Scottish east
coast. We also receive accounts of immense numbers of birds
being seen this season in Mid-Atlantic, the dates of their
appearance there agreeing very accurately with dates of observations
at the land stations. In the 1879 migration the
scarcity was accounted for by the prevalence of N.W. winds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">-92-</span>
deflecting the lines, and passing down <i>upon the right shoulders</i> (so
to speak) of the passing birds.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Even the strong-winged Wild Geese and Swans are observed when
flying well up in the wind to drift to one side a little, having the appearance
of flying <i>left-shoulder first</i> instead of head first.</p>

</div>

<p>This year the prevailing winds and gales were from east and
north-east, and while these winds do not appear to have
compressed <i>the horizontal lines so much</i> as the north-westerly did
in 1879 the birds appear to have passed at greater elevations,
and been borne away in the gales far out to sea. The migration
does not appear to have come in such great throbs or rushes in
1880 as in 1879, but to have been more dispersed and more
regular; this, no doubt, is a natural consequence of the waves
being more spread out in 1880 than in 1879. The great easterly
gales continuing for weeks together over the Atlantic and North
of Europe, so disastrous to our shipping, undoubtedly carried
many migrants far to the westward, and the mortality amongst
them must have been very great indeed, if we judge from the few
records that have reached us from sea-going vessels. These
easterly gales also have, no doubt, affected the direction of the
migration to a considerable extent, and indications of its agency
may be found in the occurrence on our shores of certain
wanderers from foreign lands, such as the Esquimaux Curlew,
on September 21st, in Kincardineshire (<i>vide</i> Zool., 1880, p. 485);
a Red-legged Hobby, on September 20th; a Turtle Dove in
Kincardineshire; and Great Snipes, Great Grey Shrikes,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> &amp;c.,
about the same dates (<i>loc. cit.</i>). These gales may be said to have
continued almost without cessation during the whole migrating
season, all through September, October, November, and December.
In November a new bird to our British list occurred,&mdash;the
Desert Wheatear, <i>Saxicola deserti</i>, Ruppell,&mdash;as will be found
duly recorded by Mr. John James Dalgleish.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was obtained
near Alloa on November 26th. Its native haunts are far to the
southward and eastward, and in North Africa, Egypt, Persia
and India.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Cordeaux has already shown to us the apparently
abnormal statistics on the south coast of England, birds crossing
towards England and flying north-west all through the migratory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">-93-</span>
season between August 16th and December. I am inclined to
look upon these data as indications of the wide-spread waves of
the general migration, extending both farther north and farther
south. According to the amount of pressure at the starting-points
[or possibly the increased area northward occupied in a particularly
fine nesting season, as in 1880] will the wideness of the
area be which is passed over by the migratory flocks. I think
the rules known to apply in the dispersal and extension of range
of species are, in some respects, applicable also to the greater and
more extensive waves of migration.</p>

<p>I could say more regarding the peculiarity of nesting sites
being occupied year after year by the same pairs of birds, or of
well-known sites being vacated for a few seasons, and again
occupied; or I might dilate upon some curious statistics of the
continuous recurrence of foreign species at the same localities,
or along the same line of country, but I fear to occupy space with
theory only, until we have a larger accumulation of solid
material.</p>

<p>As regards severity of weather apart from winds, unusually
early winter was reported from Scandinavia, it having begun
there in October (<i>vide</i> 'Field,' Oct. 16th, 1880, p. 590).</p>

<p>Attention should be drawn also to the admirable work being
done on the subject of migration by Mr. J. J. Dalgleish
(Bull. Nuttall. Orn. Club), and by Mr. Percy E. Freke
(Sc. Proc. Ryl. Dub. Soc, vol. ii., n. s., p. 373, and vol. iii., n. s.,
separate?). These gentlemen also now propose to colour, or
have already finished, maps showing the distribution of the
occurrences of American birds in Europe recorded in their
papers, which cannot fail to be of much service in our work. We
would like to see not only American species mapped out in
Europe, but rare European occurrences in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Finally, in endeavouring to arrive at conclusions regarding
the causes of migrational phenomena in 1880, we have taken
into consideration&mdash;1st. The value of the heights of lanterns
above the sea, as against the colour and intensity of lights in
1879; and we have taken more account of the vertical area of
birds' flight in 1880 than in 1879. 2ndly. We have compared
the effects of prevailing north-west winds in 1879 pressing
laterally upon the lines of migration to those of 1880, which
being easterly and north-easterly have had the contrary effect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">-94-</span>
spreading out the migration again, or at least has not deflected
it to the same extent; and also, the effect of causing birds to
migrate at greater elevations, and, where the gales have been
most severe, to bear them away above the range of vision and
carry vast numbers out to sea, until, weary and exhausted, they
have ceased to be able to guide themselves, and again, involuntarily,
lowered, to be picked up senseless and stunned on board
the ships, or to perish in thousands in the ocean. And lastly
we have hinted at the wideness of the migratory waves depending
upon the pressure at the starting-points, or upon the larger
north and south area occupied in the breeding-season of 1880,
besides some other minor details.</p>

<p>To the Elder Brethren at Trinity House our thanks are due for
their kind permission to make use of the light stations for taking
observations; and to the Trinity Superintendents, Mr. Davison
(Holyhead), Mr. Evans (Weyland), and Mr. Tregarthen (Penzance),
we are obliged for willing assistance.</p>

<p>The observers at the various stations are deserving of thanks
for the pains they have taken to keep an accurate record of the
facts coming under their notice. The reports are all interesting,
those which show a paucity of birds equally with those that
record the passing of many. Excluding the Anatid&aelig;, notes have
been taken of about fifty-two different species.</p>

<h4 id="SEPARATE_REPORT_ON_EACH_SPECIES_6">SEPARATE REPORT ON EACH SPECIES.</h4>

<p>Of the Raptores we have heard but little. A male Falcon (Peregrine ?)
was seen at Sevenstones Oct. 13th, at noon, flying S.W.,
before a moderate breeze from N.E.; at Smalls, Oct. 7th, a
Kestrel was observed flying round the tower; in Morecambe
Bay Oct. 4th, 7.30 a.m., a Sparrowhawk flying from N.N.E., a
gentle E.N.E. breeze, rested on board the light-vessel. At St.
Bees a hawk or two, we are told, may be seen occasionally;
"they build on the cliffs thereabouts."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Owl</span>, <i>Otus brachyotos</i>.&mdash;At North Stack, Oct. 13th, an Owl,
probably the Short-eared, was seen, at 8.55 a.m., flying S.W.,
before a mod. N.E. breeze. At Smalls, Oct 15th, a little Horned
Owl was observed resting on the rock; Nov. 6th, at 4 p.m.,
another on the S.E. rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fieldfare</span>, <i>Turdus pilaris</i>.&mdash;Distinguished on one or two
occasions; possibly some of the notes on "Thrush" may refer
to this. From Bishop Rock, Oct. 13th, Fieldfares were seen
at 10 a.m. passing W. before a mod. E. breeze. At Smalls,
Oct. 15th, from 1 a.m. to daylight. Grey Thrushes were noticed,
with Redwings, Starlings, and Blackbirds; breeze gentle to
moderate, E.S.E. to S.E. At Air (River Dee), Nov. 7th, "large
quantities passed at sunrise."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Song Thrush</span>, <i>Turdus musicus</i>.&mdash;Recorded from five stations.
At Caernarvon Bay, Oct. 1st, two were killed; hazy. At South
Bishop, Oct. 5th, 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., a mod. N.N.E. breeze, rain
and mist. Thrushes and Blackbirds were passing, and, of the
former, seven killed. At Morecambe Bay, Oct. 8th, 10.20 a.m.,
one Song Thrush passed S.S.W., very tired; a strong N.E.
breeze. At Nash (E. or high), Oct. 13th, one was killed; afresh
N.N.E. breeze, with mist. At Bull Point, Oct. 14th, 3 a.m.,
overcast and misty, light air S.S.W., one female is reported as
striking. At Caernarvon Bay, Nov. 2nd, a young Thrush and
Lark were killed at 9.10 p.m.; gentle E.S.E. breeze, hazy. At
Bull Point, Nov. 3rd, two struck at 2 a.m.; fresh E. breeze,
clear. At the same time there appears to have been a rush
farther south. At South Bishop, Nov. 2nd, from midnight to
morning, a fresh S.E. breeze, very misty, a very great quantity
of Thrushes, with Blackbirds, Starlings, and Larks, of which
many were killed; and, with breeze still S.E., but moderate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">-99-</span>
continuous flocks of same all day flying towards N.E.; Nov. 3rd,
from 9 p.m. to midnight, a gentle E. breeze, rather misty, large
quantities, with Larks, Blackbirds, and Starlings (many killed).
At Nash (E. or high), Dec. 1st, one was killed; fresh W. breeze,
but clear. At Godrevy, Jan. 14th, 12 to 4 p.m., Thrushes were
seen, with Lapwings and Starlings: this is the only instance
recorded in afternoon, the others being at night, the weather in
most cases misty or hazy, and the wind ranging from N.N.E.
to S.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redwing</span>, <i>Turdus iliacus</i>.&mdash;Separately noticed at one station
only&mdash;Smalls. Oct. 8th, 7.30 p.m., some were seen among
Starlings and Larks, N.E. to E., misty; twenty of the birds
killed. Oct. 9th, from midnight to 5 a.m., several, with Larks
and Starlings; eleven struck; breeze mod. to strong E. to E.N.E.,
clear. Oct. 15th, from 1 a.m. to daylight, large numbers, with
Starlings, Blackbirds, and Greenfinches. Oct. 29th, one was
caught. Nov. 2nd, several, with Sky Larks, Starlings, and
Blackbirds; sixteen struck and were caught. Nov. 3rd, three
males and five females were distinguished among Blackbirds,
Starlings, and Larks. Nov. 5th, one male; mod. N. breeze.
Except the first, the instances occurred from midnight to sunrise,
with moderate N.E., E., and S.E. breezes, and generally with
clouds, mist, or drizzle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackbird</span>, <i>Turdus merula</i>.&mdash;Reported from ten stations. The
earliest date is Aug. 12th, when one was seen at Scarweather at
1 p.m., mod. S.S.E. breeze; the latest at Skerries, Dec. 4th,
when Blackbirds and Snipe appeared, and a few were killed.
The one occurrence only is noted in August, and we do not again
hear of its appearance till at Skerries, Sept. 27th, 29th, and 30th,
when Blackbirds were seen (the two later dates in company with
Starlings). At Caernarvon Bay, Oct. 1st, Blackbirds and
Thrushes were seen, and two killed; light westerly breeze, hazy.
At S. Bishop, Oct 5th, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., N.N.E., rain and
mist. Blackbirds and Thrushes struck, and seventeen Blackbirds
were killed. At Helwick, Oct. 8th, one was killed. At Caldy,
Oct. 10th, one male was discerned flying about the lantern;
a mod. E. by S. gale, squally and cloudy. At Bull Point,
Oct. 12th, two females struck, but were not killed; a mod.
E. breeze, clear; and, on Oct. 14th, one female. At S. Bishop,
Oct. 13th, nine were killed, with five Larks. At Helwick,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">-100-</span>
Oct. 14th, one and a Linnet. At. Smalls, Oct. 15th, numbers
struck, with Starlings, Thrushes, and Finches; and, at Godrevy,
two, with two Starlings and one Thrush, not killed. At Helwick,
Nov. 2nd, several killed, with Larks and Starlings; and, from
midnight to morning at S. Bishop, a fresh S.E. breeze and very
misty, a very great quantity of Blackbirds, Larks, etc. (see Song
Thrush). At Godrevy, Nov. 3rd, one struck, not killed. At
Smalls, Nov. 2nd, two were seen at midnight; 3rd and 5th six
(two males and four females), and one female. At Nash
(E. or high), Dec. 1st, one was killed. At Skerries, Dec. 4th, a
few. The time of the occurrences noticed, except of the three
in report, which were at sunrise, was from midnight to morning,
and they took place almost always in cloudy or misty weather,
with generally a mod. breeze more or less easterly, <i>viz.</i>, N.N.E.,
through E. to S.S.E. The greatest number of instances noticed
is in October, when we have returns from seven stations, but the
birds are only seen by ones or twos; they seem to have appeared
in numbers from Nov. 1st to 3rd; in December we have only two
instances.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> have been noticed from Morecambe Bay
(from St. Bees we have the general remarks that an occasional
Blackbird or Thrush is to be seen) to Godrevy. The movement
appears to have been pretty evenly distributed, perhaps to have
spread gradually from N. to S., and to have lasted from Aug. 12th
to Jan. 14th, being most active from Sept. 27th to Nov. 27th,
with a decided rush on Nov. 2nd and 3rd. The direction of
flight is seldom given, the notices almost all referring to birds
killed or striking. The greatest slaughter occurred at S. Bishop
on Nov. 1st, when, of Blackbirds, Thrushes, Larks, and Starlings,
162 were immolated, and on Nov. 3rd 172. The time when the
occurrences were observed lies between twilight and sunrise, but
is chiefly about midnight, the weather being generally hazy,
misty, or overcast, with mod. breezes from E.N.E. through
E. to S.E. In the majority of instances the birds were accompanied
by others of their own family, or by Starlings or Larks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stonechat</span>, <i>Saxicola rubicola</i>.&mdash;At Morecambe Bay, Aug. 29th,
4 p.m., moderate breeze E. by S., one came on board. The
note is added that it is "very seldom Seen here." This is the
only occurrence noted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &aelig;nanthe</i>.&mdash;At Bishop Rock, Aug. 17th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">-101-</span>
1.30 a.m., three struck the glass, light E. breeze, cloudy;
Aug. 22nd, midnight, mod. E.S.E. breeze, cloudy and misty,
Wheatears strike; none killed on either occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chiffchaff</span> and <span class="smcap">Goldcrest</span>, <i>Sylvia hippolais</i> and <i>Regulus
auricapillus</i>,&mdash;At Scarweather, July 30th, 1 p.m., a Goldcrest
was seen. At Flatholm, Oct. 14th, a large quantity of Goldcrests
and Chiffchaffs were seen at 9.40 a.m., gentle E. breeze,
blue sky, but clouds and mist. Mr. Dale reports that, at this
station, "These little birds generally make their appearance
about the beginning of October, and remain till about the middle
of November. In spring again, from about March 20th to May.
Numbers are killed by striking the lantern on dark nights."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titmouse</span>, <i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>.&mdash;At Burnham, Aug. 16th, 3 p.m.,
mod. N.N.E. breeze, "a large flock of Blue Tits perched on the
trees, &amp;c." At Caldy, midnight, a Titmouse (species not
identified) was seen flying about the glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagtail</span>, <i>Motacilla</i> (sp. ?)&mdash;Returns only from Morecambe
Bay. Aug. 26th, 6.15 a.m., one alighted on deck; 27th,
7 a.m., one passed E., and at 8.30 a.m. one E.N.E.; 30th
three, and 31st six passed; Sept. 1st two were seen, and on 4th
six; 12th, one passed W., a gentle breeze W.S.W.; 16th, five,
S.E., a strong breeze from N.; 27th, flocks, with Linnets, were
observed during the forenoon, a light breeze S. by W., and
several small birds killed. These occurrences all happened
between 5 and 8.30 a.m. In almost every case the weather was
cloudy, misty, or foggy, with gentle breezes, varying, but mostly
E.S.E. or easterly. The direction of flight S.E. and E.S.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sky Lark</span> and <span class="smcap">Meadow Pipit</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i> and <i>Anthus
pratensis</i>,&mdash;On two occasions the Meadow Pipit is distinguished;
possibly some of the notes on "Larks" may refer to it. From
Morecambe Bay, Sept. 8th, 6 a.m., four Titlarks are reported
flying S.W., a gentle breeze E.N.E. From Smalls, Nov. 3rd,
mod. E. breeze, one was seen in company with Blackbirds and
Redwings. Of Larks, the earliest appearance noted is Aug. 27th,
when, at Morecambe Bay, seven passed flying S. by E., light
E.S.E. breeze; Sept. 1st, 5.30 p.m., about thirty passed Nash,
flying S., a gentle W.N.W. breeze; and on 3rd, at noon, about
twenty passed N., light E.S.E. breeze. These occurrences are
noticed from both stations. At Caernarvon, Sept. 4th, one was
killed. At Lundy, Sept. 9th, a number, with Chaffinches, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">-102-</span>
seen, fresh E.S.E. breeze, rain and squally; these were noticed
from both stations. At Scarweather, same day, two were seen.
At Morecambe Bay, a dozen passed flying S. At Skerries, Sept.
23rd, 9.30 to 11 p.m., many Larks and Linnets were striking, but
none killed. At Scarweather, Sept. 24th, mod. W. breeze, a
large number of Larks. From the two stations at Nash, Sept.
25th, a large flock of Sky Larks were observed passing N.E.
At Skerries, Sept. 26th and 27th, Larks were seen. At Caernarvon,
Sept. 29th, 9.15 a.m., a flock passed S.E. At Caldy,
same day, 10 p.m., two male Sky Larks and a White Gull were
flying about the lantern, light S.E. breeze, fog. At South Bishop,
Sept. 30th, four larks were killed, fog. Through September they
appear, as the month advanced, to have been noticed in greater
numbers and farther south. The appearances are nearly all in
the daytime; breezes light or gentle, varying from W. through
S. to E. Direction of flight, when noticed, towards S. or S.E.,
except at Nash, where, on Sept. 3rd, some passed N., and on
25th some N.E. At Godrevy, Oct. 4th, 1 to 2 a.m., mod. E.N.E.
breeze, a Lark, Petrel, and two foreign Wrens were seen, and
three birds killed. At Nash, Oct. 5th, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., continuous
flocks passed S.E., with mod. E.N.E. breeze, and rain; the same
direction followed, though wind veered round to W.S.W. At
Helwick, Oct. 8th, 2 a.m., one was killed, strong E.S.E.
breeze, rain and lightning. At Smalls, same date, 7.30 p.m. to
midnight, continuous flocks of Sky Larks, Redwings and Starlings,
and about twenty struck; 9th, midnight to 5 a.m., Sky Larks
and Redwings, eleven struck, mod. to strong E. to E.N.E. breeze,
clear. At Nash, Oct. 10th, a flock of Sky Larks was observed
from both stations flying N.W., strong N.E.; breeze; 13th, with
mod. E.N.E. breeze, a like flock going E. At South Bishop,
Oct. 13th, 1 to 4 a.m., light S.E. air, clouds and mist, five Larks
and nine Blackbirds met their fate. At Smalls, Oct. 12th, about
thirty struck the roof (with Starlings) from 1 a.m. to daylight;
and at Skerries, at intervals during same day, small flocks were
seen passing towards the land. At Morecambe Bay, same day,
about 10.20 a.m., a flock of Larks passed S.S.W. At Helwick,
Oct. 15th, 4.30 a.m., several Larks and Starlings were seen. At
Morecambe Bay, Oct. 16th, 2.30 p.m., a flock passed E.N.E. At
Caernarvon Bay, Oct. 19th, 1 to 4 p.m., continuous flocks passed
E.S.E., fresh E. by N. breeze. At Helwick, Oct. 21st, gentle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">-103-</span>
N.E. breeze, a flock from S.W. to N.E. At Caernarvon, Oct.
22nd, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., mod. E. gale, with haze, flocks of Larks
and Starlings passed S.E.; 24th, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., similar flocks
passed S.S.E., with a mod. N.N.W. breeze. At Helwick, Oct.
30th, 11 a.m., light N.N.E. breeze, "several hen Larks" passed
from S.W. to N.E. At South Stack, same day, 7 a.m. to noon,
fresh N.W. breeze, clear, continuous flocks (with Starlings,
Linnets, and Chaffinches) passed to N.W. Throughout October
the movement appears to have been active and pretty general
along the coast; the time of occurrence in the greater number of
cases between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.; the direction of flight, when
recorded, generally easterly; in most instances mist, rain and
fog, with&mdash;generally&mdash;moderate E.N.E. to E. breezes. At
Morecambe Bay, Nov. 1st, five passed S.E., mod. N.N.E. breeze;
2nd, three in same direction, mod. S.E. breeze. At South
Bishop, from midnight to the morning of 2nd, fresh S.E. breeze,
very misty, "a very great quantity of Larks, Thrushes," &amp;c., and
"continuous flocks" all day, flying towards N.W.; 3rd, 9 p.m. to
midnight, enormous quantities, &amp;c. (see "Song Thrush.") At
Caernarvon, Nov. 2nd, 9.10 p.m., a young Lark was killed, gentle
E.S.E. breeze, hazy; 3rd, 1 to 4 a.m., still hazy, two Larks
killed. At Helwick, Nov. 2nd, 1 p.m., fresh S.E. breeze, "a flock
of hen Larks" passed to N.E., and at 8 p.m., several more, of
which some were slain; overcast and misty. At Nash (W. or
low), Nov. 14th, noon, flights of Sky Larks and Starlings passed
overhead, strong W.S.W. breeze, clouds and mist. These are
all the instances reported in November; most of them occurred
at night, and, being of birds striking, the direction of flight is not
recorded; the winds generally moderate and from E. to S.E.;
on every occasion with mist, haze, or fog. After Nov. 14th we
have no record till Dec. 3rd, when flocks of Larks passed Skerries
at midnight, gentle S. breeze, misty. At Scarweather, Dec. 8th,
11 p.m., two Larks, mod. W.N.W. breeze, gloomy and misty.
At Lundy, same day, S.W. breeze, a great number of Sky Larks
were seen, and Mr. Parsons adds, "these are seen daily," but for
how long is not stated. At Caernarvon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Dec. 13th, 2 to 5
a.m., four young Larks were killed, mod. N. by W. breeze,
drizzling rain. At Milford, Jan. 11th, a quantity of Larks,
Plovers, and Starlings arrived and remained all day. At South
Stack, Jan. 12th, strong N.E. breeze and passing showers of snow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">-104-</span>
continuous flocks of Larks and Starlings passed all day; and on
13th, a large quantity was on the island all day. This is the
latest instance recorded. In all, we have returns from fifteen
stations, of which all but Milford and the two at Nash are off the
coast. The direction of flight, judging from the instances given,
seems to have been chiefly towards S.E. and S. (this would be
towards the mainland). The chief movement seems to have been
from Sept. 9th to Nov. 3rd, and increasing towards November.
In the majority of cases, with the breeze moderate, from E. to S.E.
and S.; in some from N. and N.E. to E.; generally with mist
or gloom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellowhammer</span>, <i>Emberiza citrinella</i>.&mdash;At Morecambe Bay,
Oct. 12, five passed about midnight, flying S.S.W., gentle breeze
from N. to N.E. by E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span>, <i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>.&mdash;At Lundy, Sept. 9th, 1 p.m., a
great number, with Sky Larks, fresh E.S.E. breeze, rain. At
Smalls, Oct. 25th, mod. W. breeze, till midnight, some struck
and fell overboard; three and a Starling caught. At South
Stack, Oct. 30th, fresh N.W. breeze, flocks, with Starlings,
Larks and Linnets, passed flying N.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountain Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer montanus</i>.&mdash;This species is
distinguished only in the returns from North Stack. Sept. 24th,
8.40 a.m., a flock passed S.W.; 26th, 2.30 p.m., with mod. S.W.
breeze, a flock passed N.W.; Oct. 12th, 8.40 a.m., two flocks
flying N.E.; 15th, 7.30 a.m., six passed S.W., mod. S. breeze;
Dec. 24th, 3.10 p.m., fresh N.W. breeze, thirty passed E.; Jan.
12th, 2.30 p.m., a flock passed S.W., before a strong N.E. breeze,
with snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer domesticus</i>.&mdash;At Nash, Sept. 27th,
6 a.m., a flight passed N.N.W. (observed from both stations),
light N.E. breeze. At North Stack, Dec. 3rd, 11 a.m., a flock of
Sparrows was seen flying N.E., against a mod. S.W. breeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenfinch</span>, <i>Coccothraustes chloris</i>.&mdash;At Smalls, Oct. 15th,
1 a.m. to daylight, many struck the roof, along with Starlings,
Blackbirds, &amp;c., mod. E.S.E. to S.E. breeze, misty; Nov. 5th,
before sunrise, mod. W. breeze, cloudy but clear horizon, two
males and one female were caught alive, together with Thrush,
Blackbird and Starling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span>, <i>Linota cannabina</i>.&mdash;From the two stations at Lundy
we learn that, from 8th Sept., a great many Linnets "mixed" have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">-105-</span>
been seen daily, and on Oct. 30th have left the island. The
earliest recorded is Sept. 1st, when at Skerries, 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.,
fresh S.W. breeze, clear, small flocks appeared with Finches,
many strike, and a few are killed; 23rd, 9.30 to 11 p.m., mod.
S.W. breeze, clear after fog, small flocks with Larks, many
strike, but none are killed. At Morecambe Bay, Sept. 17th,
7 a.m., four Grey Linnets pass S.E., mod. N.W. by W. breeze;
21st, noon, nine going N., light S. by W. breeze, misty; and on
27th, during the forenoon, fog, flocks of Linnets and Wagtails
pass, and several small birds are killed. At Caldy, Sept. 24th,
some Linnets were seen. At Smalls, Oct. 29th, one was caught
with a Redwing, fresh N.E. breeze, cloudy but clear horizon. At
South Stack, Oct. 30th, 7 a.m. to noon, fresh N.W. breeze,
Linnets, Larks, Starlings, and Chaffinches passed in flocks to
N.W. From Godrevy, we hear from Mr. Trahair that "several
flocks of Green and Red Linnets come on the island from
September to latter part of December."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;We have more notices of this
bird than of any other. Its occurrence seems to have been
general and frequent. Twenty-two stations have reported on it,
besides St. Bees, whence Mr. Pizey writes, "An occasional
Starling or Lark may be sometimes seen on the lantern-window";
and Trevose Head, where, Mr. Bowen states,
"Starlings and Crows can be observed all the year; they build
their nests about the cliffs." The earliest date given is July
24th, where, at Scarweather, 11 a.m., a flock was observed, clear,
with breeze from E.N.E. This, however, is the only occurrence
noticed till Aug. 29th, when, at Sevenstones, a large flock passed
S.W. at 5.20 a.m., fog, light N.N.E. air. The next date is Sept.
10th, when, at Nash, a large flock passed overhead at 6 p.m.,
fresh S.W. breeze. From this date several instances occur in
the Bristol Channel, but it is Sept. 28th before we hear from a
station as far north as Skerries. The occurrences then become
frequent and general along the coast, increasing to Nov. 3rd,
after which they gradually decrease in numbers and frequency
till Jan. 14th, when, at Godrevy, a great number, in company
with. Lapwings, Thrushes, &amp;c., were seen from noon to 4 p.m.,
fresh E.S.E. breeze, and clear horizon. The greatest number of
individuals are recorded from Oct. 16th to 21st, and again Oct.
29th to Nov. 3rd; we have the greatest number of occurrences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">-106-</span>
noted in November, and especially from 1st to 3rd. In September
we have returns from six stations, Flatholm to Skerries.
The flight when noticed being (except in one instance) in
daylight&mdash;mostly from sunrise to about 11 a.m. Direction of
flight scarcely ever noticed. Wind various, generally light, and
never exceeding a fresh breeze; weather in some cases clear, but
more generally overcast to misty. The next date, after 10th, is
Sept. 17th, when, at Flatholm, fresh W.N.W. breeze, a small
flight appeared and remained on the island till 19th; 22nd, from
both stations at Nash, a flock of young Starlings is reported as
flying N.E., fresh W. breeze, misty; 23rd, a flock of Starlings,
mixed, was seen at North Stack, light N.W. breeze, drizzly rain;
24th, continuous flocks were seen from Flatholm; after this no
further occurrence is noted in Bristol Channel till Nov. 1st. At
Skerries, Sept. 28th, 29th, and 30th, Starlings were seen at
sunrise, light W.S.W., S.E. and N.E. breezes. Throughout
October we have constant notices. At Morecambe Bay, Oct. 1st,
two flocks of young, mixed, passed S.W., light W.N.W. breeze.
At Nash, Oct. 3rd, continuous flocks all day passed N., against a
light N. to N.E. breeze; and at Flatholm, 3.30 p.m., mod. N.
breeze, blue sky but cloudy, there was a small flight, and <i>four
old birds were killed</i>. At Caldy, Oct. 4th, 8 a.m., strong E. by S.
breeze, about twenty were seen (first appearance). At Lundy,
Oct. 6th, strong E. breeze, rain, a great number appeared and
were seen daily till 29th, after which only one or two seen. At
Smalls, Oct. 8th, 7.30 to midnight, fresh N.E. to E. breeze,
misty. Starlings, Redwings, and Sky Larks passed in continuous
flocks (about twenty struck). At Morecambe Bay, Oct. 10th,
one seen; 11th, one passing S.E. very tired, fresh E.
by N. breeze. On 11th, we first hear of them so far south as
Scilly, where Starlings and Woodcocks passed at 8.30 a.m.,
fresh E.S.E. breeze; and on 12th, at Bishop Rock, Starlings at
10 a.m. These, however, are the only instances recorded from
these two stations. At Smalls, Helwick, and Caldy respectively,
during the nights of Oct. 14th, 15th, and 16th, several struck and
many were killed. At Caernarvon, Oct. 16th, "continuous flocks
of Starlings and Spinxes" (?) passed during the day, gentle S.S.W.
breeze, and hazy. At South Stack, Oct. 17th, 6.30 a.m., light
E. breeze, a very large flock passed. At Morecambe Bay, Oct.
21st, 5.20 p.m., gentle E.N.E. breeze, clouds but clear horizon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">-107-</span>
two to three hundred passed W.N.W. At Caernarvon Bay, Oct.
22nd, mod. E. gale, hazy, a flock with Larks passed S.E.; and
on 24th, during the day, similar flocks S.S.E.; wind now mod.
and from N.N.W. At Flatholm, same day, 8 a.m., gentle E.N.E.
breeze, small flights appeared and remained till Oct. 26th, at
7.30 a.m., when they departed S.W., fresh W.S.W. breeze,
cloudy. At South Stack, Oct. 29th, 7 a.m., fresh N.N.E. gale,
clear, very large flocks passed; 30th and 31st, fresh N.W. breeze,
continuous flocks passed to N.W. At Sevenstones, Oct. 30th,
3.30 p.m., light E. air, clear, several flocks were seen flying to
W. and N.E. At Nash, Nov. 1st, 9 a.m., gentle N.N.E. breeze,
clear, a flock of Crows and Starlings passed overland. At
Smalls, same day, from sunset to midnight, three were seen
about the lantern. At Morecambe Bay, Nov. 2nd, 4 p.m., from
two to three dozen passed, flying S.; and at the same hour, at
Helwick, a flock of male Starlings passed, flying from S.W. to
N.E., and at 8 p.m. several were killed. At Longships, 7 p.m.,
a few fluttered against the glass; at Caldy, 10.30 p.m., one was
noticed flying about the lantern; at Godrevy, 11 p.m., four
struck, several others hovering around; and at Smalls, before
midnight, mod. E. breeze, misty and drizzling, eight were seen
with other birds. At South Bishop, from midnight (of 1st), when
they first arrived, till morning, a very great quantity, with
Thrushes, &amp;c.; and all day after, continuous flocks of same
flying towards N.W. Again, on the 3rd, enormous quantities
of Starlings came at midnight (of 2nd) and continued till
morning, and at 6 a.m. the Starlings began to fly E. At
Caernarvon also, Nov. 3rd, nine young Starlings were killed,
gentle E.S.E. breeze, hazy; and at Smalls, before sunrise,
twenty-three female and four male Starlings, among Blackbirds
and Thrushes, were counted; several struck and went overboard.
At Nash, 9 a.m., large flights passed overland, with Crows; and
at Godrevy, 2 a.m., two, with Thrushes and Blackbirds, struck.
Thus there appears to have been a decided "rush" lasting from
Oct. 29th, 7 a.m., to Nov. 3rd, 9 a.m. From Nov. 1st to 3rd
alone, we hear from no less than eleven stations. It was on the
2nd and 3rd that the slaughter, already mentioned (see "Song
Thrush"), took place at South Bishop, and Starlings were
numbered among the slain. On Nov. 6th, eight were killed at
Lundy, many others striking; and after this we have almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">-108-</span>
daily returns from the two stations at Nash, of flights, the
direction, when noticed, being overland. At Helwick, Nov. 15th,
a flock passed N.E. At Bull Point, Nov. 18th, a flock was seen
flying E. At Godrevy, Nov. 29th, mod. S.W. breeze, clear, a
flock flying S. Throughout December we have almost daily
returns from Nash, of flights passing overland (on 10th and 25th
they are noticed as passing S.) At Godrevy, Dec. 2nd, 5 to 8.30
p.m., light S.S.W. breeze, misty, seventeen male and female,
mixed, struck. At Caernarvon Bay, Dec. 16th, 1 to 4 a.m.,
strong W.N.W. breeze, three killed; 27th, 9 to 11 p.m., gentle
E. by N. breeze, two young Starlings were killed; 28th, 9 a.m.
to 11 p.m., gentle N.N.E. breeze, misty, flocks passed, flying
N.W.; and on 31st, between 10 and 11 p.m., strong N.W. by N.
breeze, misty, three were killed and fell overboard. At Lundy,
Dec. 25th, fresh N.N.W. breeze, clear, a great many Starlings
came on the island during the night. At Nash, Jan. 7th, 2 a.m.,
fresh E. breeze, misty, several struck; 11th, 10 a.m., misty,
some seen with flocks of Plovers and Peewits. At Milford (Low),
same day, a quantity with Plovers and Larks arrived, and

cornix</i> and <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>.&mdash;From Caldy Mr. Ebben reports,
"The Chough breeds upon the island, and never goes away."
We do not hear of it from any other station. The Hooded Crow
is only once distinguished, but may perhaps be referred to under
the general style of "Crow," the Rook being sometimes
distinguished by that of "Black Crow." At S. Stack, Oct. 22nd,
11.30 a.m., fresh E. breeze, clear, a flock passing to N.W. Of
the Rook or, indeed, of Crows generally, the first appearance

18th, from both stations at Nash, and on 20th, 23rd and 25th,
from the low stations (9 a.m.), flights of Crows and Starlings are
reported; winds various, generally mist. On Dec. 25th, the high
station reports such a flock passing S. at the same hour, fresh
E. breeze, clear; and on 28th, 30th and 31st, same hour, with
breezes from W.S.W., E. and N., overcast, showery or misty,
flights of Crows and Starlings were seen from both stations. At
N. Stack, Dec. 20th, 9.5 a.m., a flock passed, flying E., fresh

flight is not once reported from Caldy. When from the other
stations reported it is S.E. or S.W., except at Helwick, N.E.;
Oct. 12th, at 4.30 p.m. This would be the course to the nearest

occurrences were all noticed from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., and on
every occasion with mist or rain, and with light or gentle
E. breeze (except at Caldy, W.S.W.). The direction of flight,

Godrevy, "from middle of December to middle of January
several about, not flying in any particular direction"; and,
again, "a great number of sprats about,&mdash;the Gannets appear to
be after them,&mdash;more so than on the coast, through the influence
of the weather."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tern</span>, <i>Sterna</i> (? sp.).&mdash;At Air, Oct. 12th, a large quantity of
Sea Swallows seen, mod. N.E. breeze, gloomy, clear; the same
on Oct. 12th, gentle E. breeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gull</span>, <i>Larus argentatus</i>, <i>L. canus</i>, <i>L. tridactylus</i>.&mdash;From
S. Stack we hear that, on Aug. 10th, Gulls left after breeding. At
Bideford, Sept. 1st, hundreds of common Gulls are reported as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">-117-</span>
coming every day (presumably from this date) from N.W., with
Sea-pies and Curlews, from half-ebb to half-flow. At Bishop
Rock, Sept. 6th, in calm weather and clear, a "Mackerel Bird"
(? young Kittiwake) struck (11 p.m.), but was not killed; and on
7th, 1.30 a.m., another struck. At Usk, from Sept. 7th to
Oct. 8th, large numbers of Gulls (on one occasion three varieties)
seen, with Curlews and Stints. At Caldy, Sept. 9th, Grey Gulls
seen; 10th, about a hundred Gulls, with the note, "Bred on the
island, and constantly passing." At N. Stack, Sept. 11th,
fourteen (six males and eight females) flying S., mod. S.W.
breeze. At Nash, Sept. 13th and 20th, 6 p.m., from both
stations large flocks were seen passing W., with fresh W. and
W.N.W. breeze. At N. Stack, Sept. 17th, twenty-five (thirteen
males and twelve females) are reported as flying N.E., before a
strong S.W. breeze; 25th, a flock flying S., mod. S.W. breeze.
At Caldy, Sept. 29th, 10 p.m., one White Gull appeared; fog and
light S.E. breeze. Except Usk, the only notices in October are
from Nash, where at both stations, on five or six occasions, flights
of Gulls and young Gulls were seen passing N. or N.W.; wind
various, but more or less easterly. At Caernarvon Bay, Sept. 30th,
4.15 p.m., a flock passed E.S.E., with strong S.W. by W. breeze.
We have no return in November. In December one occurrence
alone is noted:&mdash;At Nash (E. or high), Dec. 16th, 10 a.m.,
four passed N., fresh E.N.E. breeze; Jan. 9th, a small flock of
Gulls passed N. At Bull Point, Jan. 11th, 4 p.m., twenty-six
Grey Gulls passed, flying S.W., rather high; mod. N.W. breeze,
cloudy, squally, and snowy. At St. Bees, Mr. Pizey, speaking of
the scarcity of birds, says, "Even the Common Gull only makes
an appearance just before heavy weather, or in following the
plough, and then in but small numbers." From Godrevy Mr.
Trahair reports, "Very few Skua Gulls (Lestris) observed this
season."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrel</span>, <i>Thalassidroma pelagica</i>.&mdash;At Godrevy, Sept. 28th,
9 p.m., one struck, fog, light S. breeze; Oct. 4th, from 1 to 2 a.m.,
mod. E.N.E. breeze, one was seen with a Lark and Wrens. Mr.
Trahair adds, "Breeds on the island, most plentiful in July;
never seen in daytime, except among loose stones, where they
breed."</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Dotterel</span>, <i>Charadrius morinellus</i>.&mdash;Reported to be seen at
Smalls, every day from October to January, with various Gulls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">-118-</span></p>

<p>Besides the above, we have a few instances of birds unknown,
of which, perhaps, the most puzzling is reported from Longships,
Sept. 8th, midnight, mod. S.S.E. gale, misty, with showers, "one
strange bird, the shape and size of a Starling, pattern and hue
of a Partridge, with its legs covered over with stiff feathers." At
Godrevy, Oct. 4th, two foreign Wrens (? Goldcrests) killed, with
Lark and Petrel. At Skerries, Oct. 13th, 16th and 17th, flocks
of small birds passed during the day, flying E. At Smalls,
Oct. 26th, before sunrise, birds unknown passed; Nov. 3rd,
before sunrise, continuous flocks were flying round the light,
three struck and fell overboard, mod. E. breeze, cloudy, but
clear horizon. At N. Stack, Nov. 12th, 7.35 a.m., fresh W.
breeze, cloudy, two flocks of birds, name unknown, flying N.E.;
26th, 3 p.m., mod. S.W. gale, drizzling rain, fifty grey birds
passed, also flying N.E. On Jan. 16th, we hear from Longships,
that at 8.15 a.m., gentle W. breeze, cloudy, but clear horizon,
"flocks of small birds were noticed at sunrise passing westward,
leaving the land, upon a change of weather from a sharp frost
and snow, and a change of wind from E. to W."</p>

<p>The stations are not all equally favourably situated for
observing, and a general scarcity of birds is reported from the
following:&mdash;St. Bees, Mr. Pizey writes that, for over five years
that he has been there, he has remarked "the extreme scarcity
of birds of any sort As for flocks of birds I have never
witnessed them here, an occasional Robin, Blackbird or Thrush
being all the variety we see Common Sparrows few in
number." Mr. G. Knott says, "very few birds are seen at Bull
Point." From Flatholm and Usk we hear "very few land-birds
are seen, and at the former only Gulls, and they in the three
winter months alone." "The lighthouse at Avon is so close to
the docks and village that no birds come to the light "; and that
at Burnham, having "only four panes facing west, does not attract
many birds." "The land-birds to be seen in the immediate
neighbourhood of Trevose Head are very scarce." From Wolf
Rock Mr. Crask writes, "Hardly ever any birds come nigh us
but Gulls, which come by thousands after fish; the only others
ever seen being Starlings, and these few and far between."</p>

<p>Some stations report a marked scarcity during the past, in
comparison with other years. Thus, from Holyhead, Mr.
Prichard writes, "Being a very mild winter have not seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">-119-</span>
anything of note; not a bird striking this winter." At Bardsey
the inhabitants say they "never observed so few birds before;"
and Mr. Bowen suggests that "the fog-horn sounding may
prevent birds striking." With respect to this we hear from
Skerries that "few birds have been seen since they had a
fog-horn." At Morecambe, Caernarvon, and other stations
where there are fog signals, however, we hear of birds striking
or killed. At St. Judwalls the entire absence of Starlings for
the whole winter was remarked. (Pigeons were seen here from
second week in May to first week in August.) From Nash it is
reported that "during November and December sea-birds were
very scarce, and all birds singularly scarce at latter end of
October, and extremely so during the nights both of September
and October; and, again, all sea- and land-birds have been more
scarce during the nights of the present winter than ever I
recollect" (John Richards). Mr. Nicholas attributes it to the
very mild winter. From Smalls we hear that during December
no birds were seen about the lighthouse. From Hartland Point
Mr. Griffiths writes, that "for twenty-five years he had always
seen and caught birds, but not this year; nor have any struck,
as in other years." At Burnham (Aug. 14th) and at Usk (September)
a Land Rail only bird killed.</p>

<p>Concerning the circumstances under which birds strike, the
returns bear out the conclusions expressed in last year's report,
that dark or cloudy nights, with fog, haze or rain, are most
hazardous. Three or four exceptional instances are recorded of
striking in daylight. October and November appear to be the
most dangerous months, and South Bishop the most deadly
station. Mr. T. Bowen writes, from Bardsey, that "birds strike
in general with the wind; without, very rare exception." Mr.
Crask, from Wolf Rock, in reply to a question on which side
they strike, writes, "when they strike the lantern it is generally
N.W." Other stations have not noticed.</p>

<p>Of the species reported on, the Starling has received by far
the most notice; and next come Larks, Crows, Wild Ducks,
Gulls, Thrushes, &amp;c. Possibly some of the notices may refer to
local migrations, or movements from one feeding-ground to
another.</p>

<p>The notices of the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> are all in the daytime. The
direction of their flight (seldom recorded) is, sometimes, directly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">-120-</span>
N. and S.; but, to judge merely from the few recorded instances,
the prevailing direction at the following stations is N. or north-easterly&mdash;towards
the land: Caernarvon, Helwick, and Scarweather.
At Smalls it appears to be, towards the Bristol Channel,
S.E. At Nash, Godrevy and Sevenstones it is W.; while at
Morecambe Bay it varies very greatly. The lines followed by the
<i>Insessores</i> are difficult&mdash;with data supplied by one year only&mdash;to
make out, but seem to be towards the mainland or along the
coast. The following are the chief instances where the direction
is reported as being from the land:&mdash;South Stack, Oct. 29th,
30th, 31st, Starlings flying N.W.; Bull Point, Oct. 13th, Black
Crows flying W.; South Bishop, Nov. 2nd, Blackbirds, Larks,
Starlings and Thrushes flying N.W.; Scilly, Oct. 13th, Fieldfares
flying W.; and at Wolf Rock, Jan. 16th, and Sevenstones, Jan.
11th, two large flocks of Lapwings flying W.</p>

<p>The returns seem to support the conclusion expressed in last
year's report as to birds preferring to migrate with a "beam"
wind, or even a point or two abaft of beam.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
